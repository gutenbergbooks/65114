<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> present work needs but little introduction to
the English public. The author, M. F. Marion, who
holds a high official scientific position in Paris, is well
known, especially in Europe, as a popular writer on
the “Wonders of Optics,” and kindred subjects. As a
rule, the original text has been strictly adhered to by
the Translator, but in a few instances certain anecdotes
of a local character have been altered so as to be more
generally applicable, or condensed to make room for
the chapter on the Spectroscope, which is entirely
original.</p>

  <h2 id='ch1-01' class='c012'>CHAPTER I.<br /><span class='c020'>THE EYE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> Eye is at once the most wonderful and the most
useful of all our organs of sense. It is especially by
means of the eye that we gain a knowledge of the exterior
world. Our other senses are far more limited in
their action: thus the sense of touch only extends to
objects within our reach; the sense of taste is only a
delicate and exquisite modification of the sense of touch;
the sense of smell can only be exercised on substances
that are close to us; and the use of our ears is limited
by the distance at which the loudest sound ceases to
impress them. But the eye has the privilege of extending
its dominion, whether for mere enjoyment or for
serious instruction, far beyond the limits of this little
world. Not only is it the origin of all our ideas upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>every object that comes within its ken; not only does
it reveal to us our own position and that of our surroundings;
but, thanks to the discoveries of modern
science, it is able to admire, on the one hand, a world
of infinite minuteness that remained unknown to us for
centuries, and, on the other, the immeasurable immensity
of the starry universe.</p>

<p class='c021'>Admirable as the eye undoubtedly is through the
possession of the power of vision, it is also capable of
enchanting us by its own particular beauties. Not to
speak of its internal mechanism, which we shall consider
very fully by and by, let us for a moment examine
its outward appearance. Have you never, dear reader,
been enchanted with a pair of soft and gentle eyes, or
with a couple of black orbs veiled with long dark lashes,
or with those wondrous eyes that rival the heavens in
colour and depth, shedding on you rays of light whose
mute eloquence was irresistible? If it be true that
man’s face is the canvas upon which the affections and
desires of his mind are depicted as soon as they are
formed, the eyes are unquestionably the central point
of the picture, and it is in them, as in a looking-glass,
that every sentiment that passes across our brain is reflected.</p>

<p class='c021'>When the mind is undisturbed, says Buffon, all the
parts of the face are in a state of repose; their proportion,
unity, and general appearance indicate the
pleasing harmony of our thoughts and the perfect calmness
of our mind; but when we are agitated, the human
face becomes a living picture, in which the passions
that disturb us are depicted with equal force and
delicacy, a picture in which every emotion is expressed
by a stroke, every action by a letter, so to speak; in
which the quickness of the impression outstrips the will,
and reveals by the most sympathetic signs the image of
our secret trouble.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>It is more especially in the eyes, adds this great
naturalist, that these signs are manifested and recognised.
The eye is connected with the mind more than
any other organ: it seems almost to be in contact with
it and to participate in all its movements; it expresses
in obedience to it the strongest passions and the most
tumultuous emotions, as well as the gentlest thoughts
and most delicate sentiments, and reproduces them in
all their force and purity just as they have sprung into
existence; it transmits them with exquisite rapidity
even to the minds of others, where they once more become
impressed with all their original fire, movement,
and reality. The eye both receives and reflects the
light of thought and the warmth of sentiment, and is
at once the sense of the mind and the tongue of the
intellect. Persons who are short-sighted, or who squint,
have much less of this external intelligence that dwells
in the eye. It is only the stronger passions that can
bring the other features of the face into play, that are
depicted on their physiognomy; and the effects of fine
thought and delicate feeling are rendered apparent with
much greater difficulty.</p>

<p class='c021'>The elegant author of <i>L’Histoire Naturelle</i> rightly
thinks that we are so accustomed only to see things
from the outside, that we are hardly aware how much
this exterior view of everything influences the judgment
of even the gravest and most thoughtful of us. Thus
we are apt to set down a man as unintellectual whose
physiognomy does not particularly strike us; and we
allow his clothes, and even the manner in which he wears
his hair, to influence our judgment of him. Hence, our
author goes on to say, not wholly without some show
of reason, that a man of sense ought to look upon his
clothes as part of himself, because they really are so in
the eyes of others, and play an important part in the
general idea that is formed of him who wears them.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The vivacity or languor of the movement of the eyes
forms one of the chief characteristics of facial expression,
and their colour helps to render this characteristic more
striking. The different colours seen in the eye are dark
hazel, or black, as it is generally called, light hazel, blue,
greenish grey, dark grey, and light grey. The velvety
substance which gives the colour to the iris is arranged
in little ramifications and specks, the former being directed
towards the centre of the eye, the latter filling up
the gaps between the threads. Sometimes they are both
arranged in so regular a manner that instances have
been known in which the irises of different eyes have
appeared to be so much alike that they seemed to have
been copied from the same design. These little threads
and specks are held together by a very fine network.</p>

<p class='c021'>The commonest colours seen in the eye are hazel and
blue, and it mostly happens that both these colours are
found in the same individual, giving rise to that peculiar
greenish-grey hue that is far from being uncommon.
Buffon thinks that blue and black eyes are the most
beautiful, but this of course is a matter of taste. It is
true that the vivacity and fire which play so important
a part in giving character to the eye, are more perceptible
in dark eyes than in those whose tints are lighter;
black eyes, therefore, have greater force of expression,
while in blue eyes there is more softness and delicacy.
In the former we see a brilliant fire, which sparkles
uniformly on account of the iris, which is of the same
colour throughout, giving in all parts the same reflection;
but a great difference may be perceived in the intensity
of the light reflected from blue eyes, from the fact of the
various tints of colour producing different reflections.
There are some eyes that are remarkable for being almost
destitute of colour, and appear to be constituted in an
abnormal manner. The iris is tinted with shades of
blue and grey of so light a hue that it appears quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>white in some places. The shades of hazel in such eyes
are so light that they are hardly distinguishable from
grey and white, in spite even of the contrast of colour.</p>

<p class='c021'>For our part, we think that the beauty of the eye
consists not so much in its colour, or even in its harmony
with the rest of the face, but in its expression.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are also numerous instances of green eyes.
This colour is, of course, much less frequent than blue,
grey, or hazel. It often happens, too, that the two
eyes vary in colour in the same individual. This defect
is not confined to the human species, being shared by
the horse and the cat. In most other animals the colour
of the two eyes is always similar. The colour of
the eye in most animals is either hazel or grey. Aristotle
imagined that grey eyes were stronger than blue, that
those persons whose eyes are prominent cannot see so
far as others, and that brown eyes are less valuable in
the dark than those of another tint; but modern investigations
have failed to bear out the ancient philosopher’s
ideas with regard to the human eye.</p>

<p class='c021'>Although the eye appears to move about in every
direction, it has in reality only one movement, that of
rotation round its centre, by means of which the eyeball
rises or falls, or passes from side to side at will.
In man the eyes are parallel with each other in relation
to their axes; he can consequently direct them at pleasure
upon the same object: but in most animals this
parallelism is wanting. In some cases the eyes of animals
are set almost back to back, rendering it impossible
for them to see the same object with both eyes at
once.</p>

<p class='c021'>Buffon makes the remark, that after the eyes, the
eyebrows contribute more strongly than any other part
of the face towards giving character to the physiognomy,
being, inasmuch as they differ in their nature from the
other features, more apparent by contrast, and hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>strike us more than any other portion of the countenance.
They are, in fact, a shadow in the picture,
bringing its colour and drawing into strong relief. The
eyelashes also contribute their effect; when they are
long and thick, they overshadow the eye, making its
glance appear softer and more beautiful. The ape is
the only other animal besides man that possesses two
eyelashes, the rest having them only on the upper eyelid.
Even in man they are more abundant in the upper
eyelid than in the lower. The eyebrows have but two
movements, upward and downward, governed by the
muscles of the forehead. In the action of frowning we
not only lower them, but move them slightly towards
each other. The eyelids serve to protect the eyeball,
and keep the cornea from becoming dry. The upper
eyelid has the power of raising and lowering itself, the
lower one being almost destitute of movement. Although
the motion of the eyelids is an effort of will, there are
times when it is impossible to keep them open, as for
instance when we are overpowered by sleep, or when
the eyes are suddenly subjected to the effects of strong
light. The eyelid is a most admirable arrangement for
the protection of the eye, and it is almost impossible to
admire this provision of nature too much, even when
we confine ourselves to an outward examination of it.
It is not merely the outward mechanism and motion of
the eyelids, nor the colour of the eyes, that constitutes
their beauty; we have already said that the leading
characteristic of the eye was <i>expression</i>. It is this expression
which causes the eye to appear to speak, to fire
up suddenly, to sparkle with flashes of light, to languish
or conceal itself underneath its lashes, to raise itself
with inspiration, or to pierce the abyss of thought, just
according to the particular sentiment governing the
mind at the moment. Hence it is expression that constitutes
the true beauty of the eye: every one knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>instances of eyes which, while at rest, would never be
noticed by anybody, but which, when once animated by
intense eloquence, lend to the voice of their possessor
an unexpected power, which moves and transports the
listener to an extent infinitely beyond that resulting
from the simple spoken words.</p>

<p class='c021'>Enough, however, has been said upon the external
aspect of the human eye; we will, therefore, at once
endeavour to penetrate the circle in which are contained
the wonders that this little book is intended to
describe. The object of these lines is not so much to
describe the beauty of man’s glances, nor the value of
his senses, but rather to make known those illusions to
which the most sagacious of all his senses is apt to fall
a prey. But before entering the temple it was but
right to have bestowed a little admiration upon the
façade. By the way, as we are about to describe many
illusory wonders, do not let us commence by deceiving
ourselves with regard to our first marvel—the eye itself.
A great philosopher calls the eyes the windows of the
soul, and, although meant as a poetical image, the saying
is not far from the truth; for the optic nerve by
which we see external objects, is an extension of the
nerves of the brain, whose functions and actions are
an unfathomable mystery.</p>

  <h2 id='ch1-02' class='c012'>CHAPTER II.<br /><span class='c020'>THE STRUCTURE OF THE EYE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Of</span> all the senses, says an ardent admirer of nature,
the sight is certainly that which furnishes the mind with
the quickest and most widely-extended perceptions. It
is the source of the richest treasures of the imagination,
and of our ideas of the beauty, order, and unity of the
world around us. How unhappy are those whom a
hard fate has deprived of the sense of sight from their
birth! Alas! the finest day and the darkest night
differ in nothing as far as they are concerned; the light
of heaven never brings joy into their hearts. The
enamelled beauties of a bed of flowers, the varied plumage
of the peacock, the glories of the rainbow are
alike unknown to them. They cannot contemplate from
the mountain height the beauties of the valley beneath;
the fields golden with the harvest, the meadows smiling
with verdure, and watered by winding rivers, and the
habitations of man dotted about here and there over
the surface of this magnificent picture. To them is
unknown the sight of the mighty ocean; and the
innumerable legions of the cloud army of Heaven are
to them as if they did not exist. The impenetrable
obscurity which surrounds them allows them neither the
contemplation of what is grandest in man’s outward
aspect, nor even the admiration of those qualities which
they themselves would hold most dear.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>A strong sentiment of pity should, therefore, animate
the breast of every right-thinking man, when he
considers the unhappy condition of those who are born
blind.</p>

<p class='c021'>The eye infinitely surpasses in its complexity and
beauty of structure all the other organs of sense, and
is most unquestionably the most marvellous object that
the human mind is capable of examining and understanding.
Let us first examine the external parts of
this wonderful organ. With what a singular system of
entrenchments and defences do we find the eye provided!
It is itself placed in the head at a certain
depth, and surrounded on all sides by solid bone, so that
it is only with the greatest difficulty that it is hurt by
accident from without. The eyebrows also play their
part as protection to the eye, and prevent the perspiration
from entering and irritating the organ. The eyelids
too are always ready to rush to the rescue, whether
to protect the eye from outward attacks, or to shade it
from too strong a light during sleep. The eyelashes
not only add to the beauty of the eye, but they shade
it from the too brilliant light of the sun, and act as
advanced guards to prevent the entrance of dust or any
other foreign body with which the eyes might be injured.</p>

<p class='c021'>But its internal structure is still more admirable.
The globe of the eye is almost spherical and measures
nearly one inch in diameter. <a href='#i024'>Fig. 1</a> is a view of the
eyeball, showing the details of its structure; the various
membranes surrounding it have been cut away in order
that it may be better examined. If we commence our
examination by the exterior portion of the front, we
shall first find immediately beneath the eyelashes a perfectly
transparent membrane (<span class='fss'>C</span>), called the <i>cornea</i>. It
is a prolongation of the hard opaque external coating
of the eye, called the <i>sclerotic membrane</i>, and marked
S in the figure. The cornea is sufficiently hard in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>nature to present a strong resistance to any violence
from without.</p>

<p class='c021'>Immediately beneath the cornea and in contact with
it is the <i>aqueous humour</i>, a thin transparent liquid occupying
a small portion of the front of the eye.</p>

<p class='c021'>Next comes the <i>iris</i>, a circular disc perforated with a
round hole in the middle, and coloured with various
shades of blue, brown, and grey.</p>

<div id='i024'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 1.—Section of the Eye.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The opening in the centre, which appears like a black
spot when the eye is examined, is not really an object,
but simply an aperture, capable of changing its size
according to the quantity of light striking the eye.
This change of size in the opening, or pupil, as it is
popularly called, is effected by the contraction or expansion
of the iris, which thus possesses the peculiar
property of exactly proportioning the amount of light
that enters the eye, so that there is never too much or
too little. It is through the pupil that the rays of
light proceeding from the various objects around us pass
into the interior of the eye, and form an image upon
the retina, as will be afterwards explained.</p>

<p class='c021'>Immediately behind the pupil is <span class='fss'>O</span>, a bi-convex lens
to transmit the rays of light to the retina. It is generally
called the <i>crystalline lens</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>From the crystalline lens to the back of the eyeball,
is a space more or less globular in form, containing
a gelatinous diaphanous mass somewhat resembling
white of egg in appearance, and called the <i>vitreous
humour</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>Behind the vitreous humour, and immediately opposite
the pupil and lens, is the most delicate and important
of all the membranes of the eye, the <i>retina</i>,
which serves as a screen whereon are received the
images of the objects around us. This membrane is an
expansion of the optic nerve <span class='fss'>N</span> leading from the brain,
and lines the whole of the interior of the eye. The
eye is also enveloped in a second membrane (<span class='fss'>C</span>), called
the <i>choroid</i>, which is impregnated with a black pigment.
Round this is wrapped a third membrane, the <i>sclerotic</i>
(<span class='fss'>S</span>), which unites with the cornea in front of the eyeball.</p>

<p class='c021'>The crystalline lens through which all the rays pass
before they reach the retina, possesses the marvellous
power of being able to modify its curvature in such a
manner as to adapt itself to the distance of the object
seen, and thus throw a distinct image on the retina.
When we come to talk of the properties of lenses, we
shall see that the focus of a lens differs for objects at
different distances; if, therefore, the eye were not provided
with some such means for altering the focus of the
crystalline lens, we should only see objects distinctly at
one particular point. The crystalline lens consists of
infinite numbers of extremely thin transparent little
plates, each of which is in itself composed of fine fibres
so united together as to be capable of a small degree of
compression or extension. Hence the power of the
lens to alter its form according to circumstances. It is
calculated that the human eye contains over five millions
of the laminæ above referred to. With such wonders
is the world of nature replete,—wonders that we
daily and hourly pass by without examination.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>It is by means of this ingenious and inimitable structure
of the eye that external objects pass from the domain
of the material world into that of the mind, and
become accessible to every faculty of our brain. Of its
own accord, and without apparently any effort of our
own will, does this marvellous mechanism adapt itself
to all the variations of distance and intensity of light,
a power possessed by no instrument as yet constructed
by the hand of man—being capable, as it is, of distinguishing
instantaneously between the distance of the
remotest nebulæ and that of the letters forming this
page. This wonderful organ, writes Brewster, may be
considered as being the sentinel that guards the passage
between the world of matter and that of mind, and as
the medium through which they interchange all their
communications. The optic nerve perceives the objects
written on the retina by the hand of nature, and conveys
them to the brain in all their integrity of form and
colour.</p>

<p class='c021'>The path of the rays of light and the formation of
images upon the retina are shown in the preceding
figure. At first sight it will be perceived that the objects
thereon depicted are in a reversed position, that is
to say, when we look at a view similar to that shown in
<a href='#i027'>fig. 2</a>, we should find, if we had any means of observing
the positions of objects reflected on our retina, that the
flock of sheep coming up the road were at the top of the
eye, while the trees, the roof of the house, and the chimney
were in the contrary position. Similar reversed
images may be seen in dark rooms, by holding a screen
before any little crack or pinhole in the door or shutter
of the room. In <a href='#i027'>fig. 2</a> the keyhole of the door is represented
as playing the part of a lens. The author, in
common with almost every other boy, observed this fact
at a very early age, and the idea immediately struck
him that it would be only necessary to fix these images
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to procure exact representations of natural scenery; but
in making inquiries into the subject, he found that his
juvenile observations had been made a little too late,
photography having already gained the end he intended
striving for.</p>

<div id='i027'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 2.</span>—A Camera Obscura.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Seeing that the images of all objects appear on our
retina upside down, the student is naturally disposed to
ask how it happens that we do not see them in that
position. Physiologists and natural philosophers have
advanced numerous theories on the subject. Some,
with Buffon, admit at once that it is by habit and education
of the eye that we see objects unreversed.
Others, like the great physiologist Müller, imagine that
as we see everything upside down, and not a single object
only, we have no points of comparison, and practically
ignore the reversal. The truth, however, appears
to be that it is the brain, and not the eye, that possesses
the power of determining the real position of what we
see. That the eye alone has no power of determining
the positions of objects by itself, may be easily proved
by showing a person an astronomical object, such as the
moon through a telescope. Unless the observer has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>been already familiarized with the appearance of our
satellite, he will not know whether the image he sees is
reversed or not. It is the brain, therefore, and the
brain only, that has the power of determining the position
of objects around us, without taking into consideration
the reversed picture of them that is depicted on our
retina. The student who takes an interest in the structure
of this important organ, would do well to procure
a sheep’s or bullock’s eye from the butchers, and dissect
it carefully with a sharp penknife and pair of scissors.
The image formed on the retina may be easily seen by
cutting away the sclerotic and choroid coatings at the
back of the eye.</p>

<p class='c021'>The ordinary distance of distinct vision for small
objects, such as the letters of a book, is from ten to
twelve inches. But possibly there do not exist two
pairs of eyes in the world whose foci are the same.
Even in the same individual it frequently happens that
the focal length of the eyes differs considerably. In
some persons the focus of the eye is so reduced that
they are obliged to bring the object they are examining
within six, and even four inches of their eyes, before
they can see it. This defect is known ordinarily as
<i>short sight</i>, and results from the too great convexity of
the cornea and crystalline lens. It is corrected by
wearing spectacles with concave glasses. Others again,
on the contrary, place the book or object they are looking
at, at a greater distance from the eye than that
named. Such people are called long-sighted, and the
defect results from the too great flatness of the cornea
and the crystalline lens. The fault is of course corrected
by the use of spectacles containing convex
lenses.</p>

<p class='c021'>Long-sightedness is generally the result of old age,
and it may be taken as a fact that the older we grow
the flatter becomes the crystalline lens. Hence short-sighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>people have been known to recover their sight
perfectly as they advance in years through the natural
process of the flattening of the crystalline lens. These
matters, however, will be more fully treated of when
we begin to speak of the properties of lenses of different
forms and curvatures.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>It</span> is with our own organization that we shall commence
our task of exposing the illusions that we shall
meet with during our optical experiments,—in fact with
that wonderful and important organ of our body that
we are apt to look upon as sure and infallible, but
which we shall find is deceiving us constantly, and
hourly proving the fallacy of the popular saying, that
“every one must believe his own eyes.” In ancient
times there existed a school of sceptics who doubted
everything beginning with Pyrrho, the great theorist,
and ending with the follower of his school who doubted
the existence of muscular force even after he had received
a sound box on the ear from an opponent of his
system of philosophy. If any of our readers were to
become followers of Pyrrho, they might easily do so
when considering the numberless illusions we shall
describe to them, if they did not remember that if our
senses are subject to error, we have a brain to set them
right: our mind, if logical and well regulated, soon
discovers errors of observation, and speedily places our
judgment on the most solid basis. We shall find endless
instances of this throughout our little book. If
we are dazzled with illusions from time to time we shall
as often recover ourselves; and no matter how beautiful
or interesting these deceptions may appear, we shall
speedily be able to convince ourselves that they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>unreal. In this chapter we shall only speak of those
errors of the eye of which we have actually lost all
cognizance, so effectually has our judgment succeeded
in counteracting their influence.</p>

<p class='c021'>We all know that the first thing a child does with its
eyes, even when it is only five or six weeks old, is to
turn them towards the most brilliant object within its
reach. Instinctively and without being aware of it,
the child’s eye seems to seek the light. The whole of
nature, from the lowest plant to the baby in the cradle,
appears more or less endowed with this instinct of turning
towards the light.</p>

<p class='c021'>From the time that children begin to distinguish objects,
their eyes are liable to be affected by two causes
of error. Before being able to judge of the position of
things surrounding them, they see everything upside
down; they consequently acquire a false impression of
the position of objects. The next cause of error that is
likely to mislead them is the fact of their seeing everything
double, a separate image of everything being
formed on each eye; and it can only be by the experience
gained through the sense of touch that they can
acquire the knowledge necessary to rectify these errors,
and see those objects single which appear to them
double. This error of sight, as well as the first one, is
set right so easily in the end, that although in reality
we see everything double and upside down, we imagine
that we see them single, and in their proper positions,
a state of things brought about entirely through another
sense exercising its power over our judgment; and
it is hardly too much to say that, if that sense were deprived
of the power of feeling, our eyes would deceive
us, not only as to the number, but the position of the
objects within our view.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is very easy to convince ourselves that we really
see objects double, although we imagine them to be only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>single. We have only to look at the same object first
with the right eye, and we shall see it directly against
some portion of the wall of the room in which we are
sitting; then looking at it with the left eye, we shall
see that it covers a different part of the wall. This experiment
is easily tried, and is very convincing. Thus
we see that an image is formed on both eyes, and we
consequently see the object, whatever it may be, repeated
twice. By degrees, however, the eyes gain the
power of converging their axes on objects at different
distances, so that they fall on similar portions of each
retina, and so convey a single impression to the brain.
Thus, for instance, if we look at a pencil held up at
arm’s length, and then, without changing the position
of the eyeball, look at some distant object, we shall see
it double. Let us, however, converge the eyes upon it,
and the two images unite. Reverse the experiment by
now looking at the pencil without converging the eyes
upon it, and we shall see that object double in its turn.
The same thing happens if we push aside one of the
eyes with the finger while looking at any object.
During severe illness it often happens that the patient
from extreme weakness loses the power of convergence,
and consequently sees every thing double, and we continually
see children’s faces wearing a most distressing
appearance through having temporarily lost the power
of moving the muscles of the eye. It is a common expression
to use in speaking of drunken people, that they
see double, but the saying, unlike many others, is no
metaphor; when a man gets drunk he loses his power
over the muscles of his eye, just as he does over those
that sustain his body, and the instinctive closing of one
eyelid, in order that he may see objects single, is an
effort of his weakened judgment to set things right once
more.</p>

<p class='c021'>While on this subject we may mention the experiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>made by the famous English surgeon Cheselden upon a
boy who was born blind, and upon whom he operated
successfully.</p>

<p class='c021'>This boy, who was thirteen years old at the time that
Cheselden restored to him the sense of sight, was not
born absolutely blind, his affliction having been caused
by a cataract or film spread over the eyeball, which allowed
him to distinguish night from day, or black from
white or scarlet when placed in a very good light,
although he was unable to perceive the form of things
around him. At first Cheselden operated on a single
eye, perfectly restoring its power; but so little idea of
distance did the new sense convey to the boy’s mind
that for a long time he imagined that everything touched
his eyeball, just as those he felt touched his skin, and
it was only by the sense of touch that he could persuade
himself of the fallacy of his supposition. At first he
had no perception of form whatever, and could only
recognize objects he had already been familiar with
after he had felt them all over. He was a long time,
for instance, before he could distinguish between the
dog and the cat without touching them, and was greatly
surprised to find that the persons and things he had
liked best when blind were not always the pleasantest
to his newly acquired sense. His ideas of size, too,
were all at fault, and he could not, for a long time, be
made to understand how his father’s picture could be
got into the back of his mother’s watch; even after he
had possessed his sight for a comparatively long time,
he could still only recognise people he had known during
his blindness by touching their faces. Whenever he
saw a new object he looked at it attentively for some
time, in order, as it were, to learn its form by heart;
but his memory was at first so overtaxed that he continually
forgot his visual impressions, and mistook one
thing for another. He was more than two months before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>he could appreciate form as depicted in a painting
or drawing, having hitherto learned to consider pictures
as flat objects. When, however, he began to understand
the power of light and shade in producing the representations
of solid objects, he was often extremely surprised
to find the surface on which they were depicted
quite flat when he touched it. The same thing frequently
happens to ourselves, when looking at the photographs
of bas-reliefs for instance. If these objects be well
photographed, with the proper arrangement of light
and shade, the illusion is so complete that the finger
involuntarily touches the paper to feel if the surface is
not really raised. In the Bourse at Paris there are
some figures painted to represent bas-reliefs in so wonderful
a manner, that numberless bets have been made,
lost and won, over them. When feeling such representations
of solid objects, the boy would often ask
those around him which of his senses was deceiving him,
his sight or his touch.</p>

<p class='c021'>At first he saw everything of an enormous size, but
as he saw things larger than those around him, he found
the latter diminish. He also imagined that there was
nothing beyond the room he was in, and could not be
brought to comprehend how the house could be larger.
When the sight of the second eye was restored to him a
year afterwards, he at first saw every object of an enormous
size, just as in the case of the first eye; but as
he had now the perfectly educated organ to help him as
well as his sense of touch, he soon began to see things
under their natural appearances.</p>

<p class='c021'>While he was in ignorance of what sight really meant,
he was not particularly anxious to undergo the operation,
saying that he did not think it possible to derive
more pleasure from things that he liked than he did
while he was blind. But now that his sight was restored
he found every fresh object a new pleasure. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>first he was shown the landscape from the top of a high
hill, he was so delighted that he exclaimed that he had
found another sense. When his second eye was operated
upon, he saw things apparently twice as large with both
eyes as with the one already restored to him. Even at
first he seemed to have no difficulty in converging the
eyes on any object.</p>

<p class='c021'>These extracts from the history of Cheselden’s patient
show us how utterly incapable the eye must be of
rightly understanding the number, position, size, and
form of objects without frequently correcting our impressions
by the aid of the sense of touch.</p>

  <h2 id='ch1-04' class='c012'>CHAPTER IV.<br /><span class='c020'>OPTICAL ILLUSIONS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Besides</span> the errors of sight already spoken of, there
are other illusions, which are either common to all persons
or confined to certain individuals, the knowledge
of which will serve as a fitting prelude to the descriptions
of those which are artificial.</p>

<p class='c021'>The following defect, for instance, is one which is
little known, but notwithstanding our ignorance of its
existence it is nevertheless true that we all suffer from
it. There is in every one’s eye a blind spot, totally incapable
of experiencing the effects of the rays of light
when they impinge upon it. For objects situated opposite
to this particular spot we are as completely blind as
if we had no eyes at all. To convince yourself of the
truth of this assertion it is only necessary to try the
following simple experiment.</p>

<p class='c021'>Place upon a piece of white paper two small wafers,
or two blots of ink about an inch and a half apart.
Take the sheet in your right hand, and hold it up parallel
to the lines of the eyes; shut the <i>left</i> eye, and fix
the <i>right</i> eye on the centre of the <i>left</i> wafer or ink-spot.
Move the sheet of paper steadily towards the eye, until
it is about two inches and a half or three inches’ distance
from it, and you will find that in a certain position
the <i>other</i> wafer or ink-spot will disappear, although it
is evidently still in the field of view. Having discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>this point which differs for different eyes, you will find
that if you diminish or increase the distance of the
paper you will once more see the missing object. The
same thing happens if you move the eye from the centre
of the wafer. The same experiment may be repeated
with the left eye with a precisely similar result.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been found by experiment that this particular
blind space exists exactly over the base of the optic
nerve, at the spot where it joins the eye. (<a href='#i024'>Fig. 1</a>).
Thus we see that the nerve which actually conveys the
impression of sight to the brain is in itself incapable of
being excited by light. In such cases as these Nature
seems to laugh at us, and escapes from our grasp just
as we are most confident in our power of wresting her
secrets from her; indeed we may compare her to a wise
and good-natured mother, who, though always amiable
and willing to instruct those about her, sometimes
smiles when her children fancy they are as learned as
she is.</p>

<p class='c021'>If we do not perceive the constant recurrence of the
phenomenon just mentioned, it is because when both
eyes are open the object whose image falls on the blind
spot in one eye is seen by the other, the insensible
portions of each eye being on opposite sides. Not only
this: the spot being always situated on the outer and
indistinct portion of the image reflected on the retina,
we do not take notice of it; for as every one has no
doubt observed, it is only the small portion of the
object we are looking at exactly opposite the centre of
the eye that is perfectly distinct and clear, all the rest
being confused in its details, although quite visible.</p>

<p class='c021'>Again, we may account for our not noticing it by the
fact of our seeing clearly only those things which
specially attract our attention—a fact first noticed by
Mariotte. We see only what we wish to see with our
physical eyes, as well as those of our mind. If our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>attention is attracted by a particular portion of a landscape,
we see only that, and nothing else. If it is
fixed on some subject that we are contemplating inwardly,
we see nothing at all, although our eyes may
not only be wide open, but absolutely fixed on some
particular object. For instance, suppose a sportsman
is out in the fields preceded by his dogs, Bran and
Ponto. If he follows the movements of Bran with
attention, he becomes the only object animate or inanimate,
that depicts itself on his retina. Ponto may
jump and caper in vain: he is lost to his master’s eye
as much as if he were not there at all; his mind is
entirely fixed on the beauty of Bran’s coat, on the fit
of his collar, or fifty other things, and he sees nothing
else. But let the sportsman begin to think of the
number of birds he shot yesterday, or how he will find
time to get up to the grouse in Scotland, or of that
fine stag he missed when he was last amongst the
heather, and dogs, cover, and landscape will fade from
his sight as effectually as if he had been struck with
blindness. Let him, however, strike his foot against a
stump, or let the dogs suddenly begin to point, and he
instantly receives back his sight, which but a few
moments before he had lost to all intents and purposes.</p>

<p class='c021'>The phenomena of <i>ocular spectra</i> and <i>complementary
colours</i> experienced by every one forms a curious
chapter in the history of those illusions which take
their origin in the eye itself. Every one has noticed
that after looking fixedly at a bright light or a striking
colour for a few moments, the eye preserves an impression
of the object for a certain time. A very light
window looked at intently for several seconds will leave
the impression of its cross-bars on the retina for several
minutes, the colour of the image changing at every
movement of the eye. The same effect may be observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>when looking at the setting sun, or a flaring gas light.
If the light at which we look is coloured, we shall see
the complementary colour in the impression left on the
retina. Sir David Brewster was one of the first to
notice and experiment upon these very interesting
facts.</p>

<p class='c021'>If we cut out any simple figure, a small cross for instance,
in scarlet paper, place it upon a white background
and look at it fixedly for a minute or two, we
shall find that its tint will gradually become duller.
If we now suddenly look at a piece of white paper,
we shall see the cross depicted upon it in green, which
is the complementary colour to red. It should be explained,
that the complementary of any colour is that
which is necessary to make white light. Thus, blue,
yellow, and red (as we shall find out when we come to
speak of the prismatic spectrum), mixed in certain proportions,
form white light; consequently the complementary
of orange, which is composed of red and yellow,
will be blue; of green, which is yellow and blue,
red; of purple, which is blue and red, yellow, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. The complementary of black is white, and of
white, black as a rule; but if the white object be very
brilliant, the black spectrum will speedily become coloured.
The impression left by the setting sun is of this
character. At first, while the eye is open, the image
is black, then brownish red, with a light blue border;
but if the eye be shut suddenly, it becomes green, with
a red border, the brilliancy of colour being apparently
in proportion to the strength of the impression. These
spectra may be perceived for a long time, if the eye is
gently rubbed with the finger now and then. Some
eyes are more impressionable in this respect than
others, and Beyle gives an instance of an individual
who saw the spectrum of the sun for years, whenever
he looked at a bright object. A modern instance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>this occurred lately to an amateur astronomer who was
looking at an eclipse of the sun. He unfortunately
used a glass that was not sufficiently smoked, and the
image of the sun’s disc, with the black space caused by
the intervening moon, remained on his retina for months
after. This gentleman’s case afforded an instance of
the necessity of attention in order to see any object,
for after the first few days he only became sensible of
his unfortunate mishap when his attention was called to
it by some accidental circumstance. These facts were
so inexplicable to Locke, that he consulted Newton on
the subject, and was surprised to learn that the great
philosopher himself had suffered for several months
from a sun-spectrum in the eye.</p>

<p class='c021'>Without affirming that optical illusions are the cause
of all the supposed supernatural appearances of which
we have heard so much, there is no doubt that in many
instances the eye plays an important part in deluding
the brain. The following example, also cited by Beyle,
will show this clearly. A horseman dressed in black,
and riding a white horse, was trotting along a portion
of the road, which through a sudden break in the
clouds was brilliantly illuminated by the rays of the
sun. The black figure of the man was projected
against a white cloud, and the horse appeared doubly
brilliant from being seen against the dark-coloured road.
A person who was greatly interested in the arrival of
the horseman was watching them with great attention,
when suddenly the horse and his rider disappeared behind
a wood. An instant after the observer was terrified
at seeing a <i>white</i> cavalier on a <i>black</i> horse projected
on a white cloud at which he was accidentally
looking. It may be readily imagined that such an occurrence,
followed up by a succession of unusual events,—such
as illness, death, or any other series of misfortunes,—might
even in the present day add a chapter to
the history of the marvellous.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>To the illusions to which, like the preceding, we are
all subject, may be added those resulting from some abnormal
conformation, or some disease of the eye, in
those who labour under them. An example of this occurs
in the case of double or triple vision, many remarkable
instances of which are mentioned by Müller,
the celebrated physiologist.</p>

<p class='c021'>Although, as before explained, the image of an object
is depicted at the same time on both our eyes, still we
only see one impression, in consequence of the two
images being carried to the brain from corresponding
portions of the retina. If this relation be disturbed by
any cause, or if the eyes are not converged exactly
upon the same point, a double image is the result.
The first of these facts may be proved by looking at
the moon, for instance, with the left eye shut; on
suddenly opening it, two images will be seen for an
instant. The second is instantly proved by pushing
either of the eyes aside with the finger, when looking
at any object.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is necessary, however, to distinguish between these
effects and true double vision, as well as a certain defect
which exists in the eyes of many people, consisting in the
apparent multiplication of distant objects by the same
eye. In these cases, there is a superposition of images
upon the retina, each having its proper bounds. With
the majority of individuals afflicted in this way, it
only happens when they look at a very distant object,
the moon or stars for instance. There are many, however,
who suffer from it in the case of everything they
look at, whether far or near. Stephenson, who was affected
with it, made it the subject of many interesting experiments.
When he looked at a clear mark on a white
ground, and gradually walked away from it, not only
did the image become indistinct, but it seemed to unfold
itself into several, independently of many others much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>more indistinct, more especially two situated on each
side, whose distance increased the farther he walked
away. As these latter images became more and more
separated, they also became more confused. The image
seen by the right eye was a little higher than that
seen by the left. Griffin states, that after having used
the telescope for any length of time, the eye that he
kept shut always saw objects triple and double for
some hours afterwards. These phenomena are possibly
connected in some way with the disposition of the
plates and fibres of which the crystalline lens of the
eye is composed.</p>

<p class='c021'>Semi-vision, or <i>hemiopia</i> as it is called, is much more
rare and more difficult to explain than the phenomena
of double vision; and consists in the power of being
able to see only the right or left half of the object
looked at, the separation being vertical when the eyes
of the observer are in the same horizontal line. Thus,
in looking at the word <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, the person so afflicted
would only see either the letters <span class='sc'>New</span> or <span class='fss'>TON</span> according
to which half of the eyes were defective.</p>

<p class='c021'>Wollaston was afflicted with hemiopia on two different
occasions; the first time after violent exercise,
during two or three hours, when he could see distinctly
only the left-hand halves of the objects he was looking
at. Both eyes were similarly affected, and the phenomenon
only lasted about a quarter of an hour. Twenty
years afterwards he suffered again from the same
accident, but on this occasion in the contrary manner;
that is to say, he only saw the right halves of the
objects he was looking at—to use his own words, he
could only see the right half of every friend he met.
At certain distances from the eye, one of two persons
would become invisible, and by simply changing
his own position or that of the persons he was near,
he could make one or other of them, or indeed both,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>disappear at will. It must be acknowledged that
similar tricks of Dame Nature, due to an unconscious
insensibility of the eye, are most singular, and at first
sight appear to have a supernatural origin.</p>

<p class='c021'>Bartholin mentions the case of a hysterical woman
who was afflicted with hemiopia horizontally, and saw
all natural objects cut in two, the lower halves being
invisible. In this instance it was only the left eye that
was defective.</p>

<p class='c021'>Another interesting example of optical illusion is the
luminous sensation produced internally when the eye,
or the neighbouring parts, are struck or stimulated by
friction or electricity. These appearances are experienced
even by those who have lost their sight. Müller
states that a case was submitted to a legal tribunal to
decide whether the luminous sensations which are perceptible
when we rub our eyes are really light. The
matter in dispute was whether a man who was attacked
by robbers in the dark, could see and recognise them by
means of the light produced in his eyes by a violent blow
on the head; but he does not tell us how the question
was decided. With regard to internal causes, Humboldt
tells us that a man whose eye had been extirpated,
was sensible of luminous appearances whenever he was
galvanized. Lincke states that a man whose eye had
been removed by a surgical operation, saw next day all
kinds of luminous phenomena, which tormented him cruelly
with the idea that after all his eye had been saved.
When he shut the perfect eye, he fancied he saw with
the missing eye circles of fire, persons dancing, and similar
appearances for several days. These facts are
analogous to those told of persons who have had their
legs and arms amputated, but who, notwithstanding,
apparently feel pain in their lost limbs.</p>

  <h2 id='ch1-05' class='c012'>CHAPTER V.<br /><span class='c020'>THE APPRECIATION OF COLOUR.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Most</span> people understand each other sufficiently to
agree in their ideas about various colours. Thus every
one agrees in saying that poppies are red, that the sky
is blue, and the leaves green; but if any one were to
assert that the sky was red, that the leaves were blue,
and poppies green, who could possibly contradict him?</p>

<p class='c021'>This statement may appear a paradox, and an absurdity
to many of our readers, but it is really a problem
that has engaged the attention of many of our greatest
philosophers. Who can prove that what I see as yellow
may not appear blue to you, or that what you see
red is not green to me? You would possibly explain
the doubt by saying that because we both agree in calling
a buttercup yellow, that we see the same colour. I
call a buttercup yellow, because I have learnt since my
childhood to give this name to the particular sensation
I experience when I look at one of these flowers; but
that is no proof that the sensation I feel is similar to that
felt by everybody else, and it is not merely possible, but
probable, that our personal sensations of colour are essentially
different, although the arbitrary words we use
to designate them are the same.</p>

<p class='c021'>It may be remarked in parenthesis, that colour is not
an entity, but is simply the effect of certain properties
of surface or interior structure possessed by every substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>with which we are acquainted. The old saying,
that “all cats are black in the dark,” is really a profound
philosophical truth, which is not only true of cats
but of the reddest rose that ever grew in a garden, the
bluest violet that ever was plucked, the prettiest girl
that ever was kissed under the mistletoe. It is a sad
thing to think of, that when we put the candle out, and
step into bed, we become blacker than the blackest negro
that was ever emancipated. But without light
there can be no colour, for there is no material, so to
speak, from which to manufacture it. White light, as
we have said before, is made up of red, blue, and yellow,
and it is by the absorption of one or all of these
that all tints are formed. The surface of a poppy leaf
has the power of absorbing all the blue and a little of
the yellow, reflecting the whole of the red and the remainder
of the yellow, the mixture of the two forming
scarlet. The surface of a marigold acts differently; all
the blue is absorbed, as in the case of the poppy, and a
good deal of the red with it, leaving just a little to
brighten up the yellow which is reflected with it. Some
substances, white marble for instance, have no power
of splitting the light into colours, absorbing some and
reflecting others, but reflect the whole of it in its integrity.
Others again, like black velvet, absorb nearly
the whole, just reflecting sufficient to enable us to see
its surface.</p>

<p class='c021'>We began this chapter by speculating on the probability
of our seeing different colours to our neighbours,
and we shall now proceed to show that our speculations
in that direction are not so absurd as they appear to be
at first sight.</p>

<p class='c021'>The phenomenon of colour-blindness, or the insensibility
of the eye to certain colours, has been for many
years past a puzzle both to the physiologist and the
philosopher. Perhaps the most remarkable case of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>sort is that mentioned first by Huddart, and quoted by
Sir David Brewster, of a shoemaker named Harris,
living at Maryport, in Cumberland, who was utterly
incapable of distinguishing any colour at all, and saw
everything white, grey or black. The first time that
Harris noticed this defect, was when he was about four
years old; having found the stocking of a playmate in
the street, he returned it to him at his cottage, and
noticed that every one said it was a red stocking, but he
could not understand why they should call this particular
stocking red, as it seemed to him to be like every
other. This circumstance remained in his mind, and a
few more similar observations confirmed his suspicions
that he had some defect of sight that prevented him
from seeing as others did. He also observed that other
children pretended to distinguish cherries from their
leaves by what they called their colour, whilst he could
see no difference between them, except those of shape
and size. He also noticed that by means of the difference
of colour, others could distinguish cherries on a tree
at a much greater distance than he could; whilst he, on
the contrary, could see other things at greater distances
than his companions. Harris had two brothers, whose
eyes were similarly defective; one of these, that Huddart
examined, mistook green for yellow constantly, and
orange for light green.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> Scott describes a
similar defect in his own powers of vision. He states
that he was unable to distinguish green, and that the
colours known as crimson and pale blue presented no
difference of hue. He further confesses his inability to
see any difference between bright green and bright red,
although he could distinguish between red and yellow,
dark blue, and almost every shade of blue, except sky-blue.
He goes on to relate how he married his daughter
to a worthy young man of his acquaintance, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the day before the wedding the bridegroom came to his
house in a full suit of black, as he thought. He was
greatly displeased to see him appear in mourning on
such an occasion, and took an opportunity to remonstrate
with him on the subject. But what was his surprise to
hear his daughter exclaim, in loud tones of counter remonstrance,
that she had rarely seen her lover in a coat
of such a pretty colour, and that her father’s eyes must
deceive him on this as on many other occasions. Scott’s
father, his maternal uncle, one of his sisters, and two of
his sons had the same defect of sight. Dr. Mitchell
mentions the case of a naval officer who for his ordinary
uniform chose a blue coat and waistcoat and red trousers,
fully believing that they were all of the same colour. A
tailor of Plymouth, also mentioned by Dr. Mitchell,
mended a black silk waistcoat with a piece of crimson,
and another put a red cloth collar to a blue coat. Several
celebrated men have suffered from colour-blindness.
Amongst them may be mentioned Dugald Stewart, the
great philosophical writer; John Dalton, the originator
of the atomic theory; and Troughton, the philosophical
instrument maker. Dugald Stewart first discovered the
defect on hearing a member of his family admire the
contrast of colour between the leaves and fruit of a Siberian
crab-tree, while he could see no difference between
them, except in point of form and size. John Dalton
could not distinguish blue from crimson, and he could
only see two colours, blue and yellow, in the prismatic
spectrum. Troughton could see no difference between
dark crimson, bright orange, and yellow—in fact, he
could only distinguish blue from yellow.</p>

<p class='c021'>In an article on this subject, published in the <i>Magasin
Pittoresque</i> for 1846, a Swiss physician gives some
interesting examples, which are worth repeating. In
the solar spectrum obtained by passing a ray of light
through a triangular prism, and which is composed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the following colours,—red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet,—Dalton could only see yellow, blue,
and violet. Rose-colour by day appeared to him a pale
blue, but at night it seemed to take an orange hue. By
day crimson seemed to be dirty blue, and red cloth dark
blue. Dr. Whewell having asked him one day to describe
the colour of the doctor’s scarlet gown, Dalton pointed
to the trees around them, and declared he could distinguish
no difference in their colour; and one day having
dropped a stick of red sealing-wax in the grass, he had
the greatest difficulty in finding it again. Since Dalton’s
time over five hundred distinctly marked instances
of this imperfection have been noticed, and Professor
Prévost, of Geneva, has named it <i>Daltonism</i>, an extremely
unphilosophical piece of pathological nomenclature,
which has unfortunately received the sanction
of too many great physiologists to be abolished. Blindness
might just as well be called <i>Homerism</i> or <i>Miltonism</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>Colour-blindness is much more frequent than is generally
supposed, for those who are afflicted with it are
mostly ignorant of the defect, and frequently practise
trades or professions in which perfect sensibility to the
different hues of colour is quite indispensable. An instance
of this occurred some time since in the case of
an engine-driver, who allowed his engine to run into a
luggage train, through not noticing the red danger signal.
At his examination it was proved that he was
colour-blind, and could not distinguish red from green.
Partial colour-blindness is, no doubt, the cause of the
frequent disputes that we hear about the tints of certain
objects; to say nothing of the glaring instances of
bad taste in the arrangement of colour that are now-a-days
so common. Out of forty boys at a school at Berlin
who were examined by Leebech, he found five who
were quite confused in their notions of colour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>could not distinguish between ordinary shades of the
same hue. This affliction is in many cases hereditary,
descending from father to son. It is singular that instances
of colour-blindness are much more common
amongst men than amongst women, for out of over five
hundred cases there were only four in which females
were the sufferers. It seems also that persons with
grey eyes are more frequently colour-blind than those
whose eyes are blue or brown. To the list of great
men who were colour-blind, we must not forget to add
the celebrated Italian historian, Sismondi.</p>

<p class='c021'>Physiologists consider that there are two kinds of
colour-blindness,—one where only two colours are seen,
the other where more than two are perceptible. Daubeny
Turberville, an oculist of Salisbury, mentions a
case of the former, in which a young girl, like the Maryport
shoemaker mentioned by Brewster, could only distinguish
between black and white, everything between
the two being of different shades of grey. This girl, singularly
enough, could see to read in twilight a quarter
of an hour after her companions. This sharpness of sight
appears to be not at all uncommon amongst those who
are colour-blind. Spurzheim mentions the ease of a
whole family who were afflicted in the same way as
Turberville’s patient. All the male members of Troughton’s
family were equally incapable of distinguishing any
colours but blue and yellow.</p>

<p class='c021'>The cases of colour-blindness where more than two
colours are distinguishable, are much more common.
Goethe, the great German poet, who dabbled a great
deal in optics, knew two young men who, although they
possessed powerful sight, and could distinguish between
white, black, grey, yellow, and orange, were at a loss
when the shades between dark red and rose-colour were
in question. A piece of dried carmine appeared bright
red to them, and a faint carmine hue on a white shell,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and a rose-leaf, light blue; the leaves of trees and grass
appeared yellow, and they confounded rose-colour, blue,
and violet together. Goethe supposed them to be incapable
of perceiving blue and its several hues, and called
their defect by a high sounding Greek name, <i>akyanoblepsy</i>,
or blue-blindness. Péclet mentions two other
persons, also brothers, who likewise were incapable of
distinguishing between blue, violet, and rose-colour.
Like Professor Whewell, they confounded the dull scarlet
of the trousers of the French infantry with the
leaves of the trees. Yellow appeared to them more brilliant
than any other colour. Doctor Sommer and his
brother could not distinguish between red and its derivatives
and other colours; they could only distinguish
between yellow, blue, white, and black. Doctor Nicholl
mentions a child that could only see red, yellow,
and blue, in the spectrum. It could distinguish green,
but called it brown when it was dark, and pink when it
was pale. The same physiologist knew a man who
called red green, and brown dark green. A young lady
who was an amateur artist, could not perceive a piece of
scarlet cloth hanging on a hedge that was close to her,
although others could see it plainly half a mile off. One
day she gathered, as a great curiosity, a lichen which
she supposed to be of a bright scarlet hue, but which
was in reality of a beautiful green. Another time she
could see no difference between carmine and prussian
blue. A gardener living at Clydesdale, who began life
as a weaver, was compelled to give up his first trade because
in daylight he confounded all light colours; yellow
and its varieties he could distinguish perfectly, but
he was incapable of seeing any difference between red,
blue, pink, brown, and white. Another man, who was a
silk-weaver, had to change his trade, because he could
not distinguish between red, pink, and sky blue. A
Genevese artist whom circumstances compelled to paint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>a portrait by candle-light, used yellow for pink in laying
on his flesh tints, with a pleasing result that may be
readily imagined. In fact, the instances of colour-blindness
mentioned by physiological writers are almost
innumerable, and I should only weary my readers if I
related all the authentic cases of this singular affliction.
One instance, however, which was very carefully observed
by Wartmann, a distinguished German oculist,
merits our attention. The afflicted person, whom Wartmann
speaks of as D., was thirty-three years old. Those
of his brothers and sisters whose hair was fair suffered
from the same infirmity, but those whose hair was dark
were exempt from it. Like so many others who are colour-blind,
he could not distinguish between cherries and
their leaves, and confounded a sea-green piece of paper
with a scarlet ribbon placed near it. A rose of the
ordinary hue appeared greenish-blue. Being anxious to
see if reflected, refracted, and polarized light exercised
a different action on his retina, Wartmann tried him first
with the prismatic spectrum, but he could only distinguish
four colours,—blue, green, yellow, and red. He
could distinguish perfectly the peculiar black lines seen
crossing the spectrum in certain places, and known by
the name of Fraunhofer’s lines. He then placed in his
hands thirty-seven pieces of differently coloured glass,
but he could only distinguish four varieties. The colours
produced by polarized light seemed to give the patient
quite as much trouble as those produced in the ordinary
way. Chocolate brown appeared reddish brown; purple,
dark blue; and violet, a dirty blue. When colours were
illuminated by sunlight, they seemed to him to be redder
than usual, even green and blue appearing red.</p>

<p class='c021'>In considering cases of colour-blindness, it is very
difficult not to be misled into using wrong terms, as applied
to colour, for we have no possible means of knowing
what colour it is that is really seen by the patient.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Thus, for instance, Dr. Whewell could not distinguish
between red and green. But what colour did he really
see? Did he see the leaves and cherries both red or
both green, or was it some colour between the two that
was impressed upon his retina? Again, great care
must be exercised in placing implicit reliance on the
statement of persons who are colour-blind, for we must
recollect that their only means of conveying the results
of what they experience is by the use of an organ that
is confessedly defective, and which is quite likely to
deceive them, and us too, without their being parties to
the deception.</p>

<p class='c021'>The cause of colour-blindness is completely unknown;
philosophers and physiologists are still in the realms of
hypothesis concerning this peculiar optical defect. As
yet, the most careful observation has failed to detect
any difference between the eyes of those who are colour-blind,
and the eyes of ordinary persons, that could in
any way account for this singular affection of the sense
of sight.</p>

  <h2 id='ch1-06' class='c012'>CHAPTER VI.<br /><span class='c020'>ILLUSIONS CAUSED BY LIGHT ITSELF.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>When</span> playing about the Christmas fire, children
frequently amuse themselves by whirling round and
round a piece of wood, one end of which they have
previously lighted and blown out. In proportion as
the movement becomes more rapid, the path of the red-hot
end becomes more and more connected, until at last
a burning ring is formed, in every part of which the
shining charcoal appears to be at the same time. The
only way of accounting for this illusion is by supposing
that the image formed by the burning stick upon the
retina remains there for an appreciable period, the impression
made by it at one part of its journey remaining
until it returns to its former position. The power
possessed by the retina of retaining impressions
explains a large number of illusions of the same kind.
The chord of a musical instrument, for instance, when
struck, appears to occupy a longer space during the
time it vibrates, than when it is at rest. A rapidly revolving
wheel appears almost solid on account of the
combined images of the spokes seeming to unite into
one homogeneous mass.</p>

<p class='c021'>The persistence of luminous impressions upon the
retina has given rise to the invention of a number of
well-known optical toys, amongst which may be
mentioned the <i>phenakistiscope</i>, the <i>thaumatrope</i>, the
<i>phantascope</i>, and many others.</p>

<div id='i054'  class='figleft id007'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
<img src='images/i054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.</span>—The Phenakistiscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The phenakistiscope may be described (<a href='#i054'>figs. 3</a> and <a href='#i055'>4</a>)
as consisting of an iron pin <i>a b</i> turning easily on its
axis, and passing through two holes in a brass rod <i>t g</i>,
bent twice at right angles. Attached
to one end of the pin is a disc of cardboard,
divided into several equal sectors,
and pierced near its circumference
with as many similar sized rectangular
holes (<a href='#i055'>fig. 4</a>). In each sector the same
scene is represented, with this difference,
that the movements of the objects
are so arranged as to be progressive
from one extreme to the other. The
disc being fastened to the pin <i>a b</i> (<a href='#i054'>fig. 3</a>)
by the screw <i>v</i>, with the figures facing
outwards towards <i>a</i>, the whole apparatus
is held before a looking-glass
by the handle <i>m</i>. If the disc be now
rotated by the button <i>b</i>, and the eye
placed opposite one of the square holes
in the card, the figures on the disc will appear to move
more or less quickly according to the rate at which it is
rotated. The three bricklayers in <a href='#i055'>fig. 4</a> will be seen
to pass their bricks from one to the other with perfect
regularity if the drawing has been made carefully.
Numberless other designs may be made for this little
instrument, such as a windmill in full sail, a man working
a pump, a conjurer swallowing knives—in fact, any
scene with objects in motion may be drawn, and will
cause infinite amusement for the long winter evenings.</p>

<p class='c021'>The time during which the impression of any object
remains upon the retina appears to be in direct proportion
to its brilliancy. For a burning coal it is stated
to be about the tenth of a second; consequently, if the
stick mentioned at the beginning of the chapter is
rotated ten times in a second, a continuous luminous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>ring will appear to be formed. That the time necessary
for producing a distinct impression varies with the
brilliancy of the object, may be readily guessed from
the fact that an electric spark is perfectly visible,
although its duration can hardly be measured, while a
cannon-ball in flight is only perceptible to the practised
eye of the artilleryman, owing to its reflecting only a
small quantity of very diffused light.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 4.</span>—Disc of the Phenakistiscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The second instrument, the thaumatrope, is constructed
on the same principle. It consists of a certain
number of circular discs of card three or four inches
across, which are capable of being turned on their axes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>with great rapidity by means of the finger and thumb and
a couple of silk threads fixed at opposite sides of their
circumference. On each of these discs a design is
painted, one-half appearing on one side, and the other
half on the other, in such a manner that the two parts
form a single picture. You may have, for instance,
Harlequin on one side and Columbine on the other, but
on turning the card you will see them together. The
body of a Turk may be drawn on one side and his head
on the other, and, by rotating the card, the head suddenly
finds a pair of shoulders to fit it. A sentence
may be divided in the same way, or the words, or even
the letters, may be divided between the opposite sides
of the card: in fact, like the phenakistiscope, the designs
applicable to this little instrument are endless.</p>

<p class='c021'>The third of these instruments, the phantascope, is
constructed in accordance with the peculiar power possessed
by the eyes of adapting themselves to the distance
of the objects they are looking at. Everybody
must have noticed that in order to see objects plainly
that are placed at different distances we insensibly alter
the position and focus of the eyes, and that, consequently,
objects even in the same plane as those we are
looking at are not perceived by us until something calls
our attention to them, and causes us to alter the position
and focus of our eyes and fix our gaze on them.
For instance, in looking at a canary in a cage, we have
but a confused idea of the wires, which we will suppose
to be midway between the bird and the observer. But
if anything attracts our attention to the wires we lose
sight of the bird, or at any rate see it only as a confused
mass. If this experiment is made with care, it
will be perceived that the object seen confusedly is
always double,—a fact that may be verified by interposing
the finger between the eyes and any object.
When we look at the finger, the distant object will seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>to be doubled; if we look at the object, it is the finger
that undergoes duplication.</p>

<p class='c021'>We know by experience that when we look at an object
and press one of the eyeballs slightly with the
finger, the image of it becomes doubled. The explanation
of this phenomenon is not very easy, but it is generally
supposed that in the case of ordinary vision the
two eyes produce the sensation of a single image in
consequence of the two impressions being formed at
corresponding parts of each retina, and that habit
causes us to see only a single object in such a case.
But when the eyes are so disposed as to be capable
of seeing distant objects distinctly, the two images
formed by a near object are no longer found in the corresponding
portions of each retina, and so produce the
sensation of double vision. The same thing happens
when either of the eyes is momentarily displaced.</p>

<p class='c021'>These phenomena have given rise to the construction
of a very simple instrument, the phantascope, with
which many interesting experiments may be performed,
and which was invented some years since by Dr. Lake,
an eminent physician of New York.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the middle of one of the edges of a thin piece of
wood, say six inches or a foot in length, which serves
as a base for the instrument, is fixed a rod fourteen or
sixteen inches long, upon which slide a couple of ferules
capable of being fixed at any height by means of
thumb-screws. Each of these ferules holds a piece of
cardboard five or six inches long, and of any convenient
breadth, in a horizontal position. The upper card is
pierced in a longitudinal direction with a slit rather less
than a quarter of an inch broad, and about three inches
long; that is to say, a little wider than the distance between
the centres of two eyes. The second card has a
similar slit of the same length, and corresponding vertically
with the one above it; the width, however, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>this instance being only about the eighth of an inch. In
addition, the lower card should be marked with a fine
line drawn across the centre, which we shall call the index.</p>

<p class='c021'>Things being thus arranged, if we place two similar
objects—two A’s, for instance—upon the wooden stage
of the instrument, about three inches apart, and look
at them through the two slits, we shall see them as under
ordinary circumstances; but on fixing our eyes intently
on the index of the lower card, and gradually
raising it, we shall see the two A’s become double, the
two images of each letter separating themselves more
and more the nearer the lower card approaches the upper
one, until the last two of the images will coalesce,
and appear to be placed on the lower cardboard, the
other two remaining in their proper place. The eyes
must be kept firmly fixed upon the index, otherwise the
illusion disappears immediately, and two A’s only are
seen in their true position on the base of the instrument.
This is an instance of the production of an image in a
place where it certainly does not exist. This illusion
is seen best when the upper screen is about ten inches
from the object, the lower screen being just half-way
between; but, as in most of these cases, the distances
will differ according to the focus of the observer’s eyes.
The proper distances once being found, the experiment
may be varied in a hundred different ways. For example,
instead of two letters and a line we may have
two flowers on the stage, and the figure of a flower-pot
on the intermediate screen. If the two flowers are
painted different colours, they will unite and form a
mixed tint. Thus a red and yellow flower will give an
orange image, a blue and yellow a green image, and so
on. A perpendicular stroke and a horizontal one will
give a cross. A few experiments with this little instrument
will throw a light upon many of the obscurer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>points that exist amongst the phenomena of vision, and
will show conclusively that the two eyes rarely see in
the same manner, and that it is sometimes one, and
sometimes the other, that sees most distinctly. A
couple of pieces of cardboard, pierced with suitable
slits and held in the hand may be substituted for the
apparatus above described, but of course they will be
much more difficult to use, and will give less satisfactory
results.</p>

  <h2 id='ch1-07' class='c012'>CHAPTER VII.<br /><span class='c020'>THE INFLUENCE OF THE IMAGINATION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> above facts show plainly that optical illusions
find their source in the very mechanism of the organs
of sight, and that without going farther than the eye
itself we may discover numberless examples of these
phenomena. We shall presently bring before our readers
the innumerable means devised by art for deceiving
the sense of sight and impressing us with sensations that
are purely imaginary. But before describing these numerous
pieces of apparatus we must still remain for a
short time within the domain of man’s faculties, and describe
some of the illusions that we are subjected to by
those powers of the imagination that are supposed to
hold in check the five senses of the body. Our imagination,
however, plays us as many tricks as our eyes,
and, like them, is alternately false and true. Touch,
taste, smell, hearing, and sight, are all supposed to be
under its powerful influence for good or evil; but they
are all deceived by it in turn, more especially the sense
of sight, which we generally boast of as being the most
trustworthy of them all. Were we to describe all the
labyrinths into which our imagination is continually
leading us, we might easily extend this little volume to
one of treble the size. But our purpose is not so much
to write a history of all the hallucinations to which the
imagination is subject, but to cull from those already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>existing the most interesting instances in which this
great faculty is alternately the victim and the tyrant of
the sense of sight.</p>

<p class='c021'>Amongst many works on this subject we may cite that
of Brière de Boismont on “Hallucinations, Apparitions,
Visions, &amp;c.,” from which we shall draw largely in the
following pages. The examples we shall give will be
those only in which the victims of the hallucination were
in the full enjoyment of their mental faculties, and could
healthily analyze the sensations and impressions to which
they were subjected.</p>

<p class='c021'>One of the first of these bears upon those diseases of
the eye to which allusion was made in <a href='#ch1-04'>Chapter IV</a>.
Towards the end of 1833, a poor washerwoman who was
tormented grievously with rheumatic pains gave up her
business, and took to sewing for her livelihood. Being
but little accustomed to this kind of work, she was compelled
to sit over her needle late at night in order to save
herself from starving. The unwonted strain upon the
eyes soon brought on ophthalmia, which speedily became
chronic. Nevertheless, she continued her work, and
fell a prey to <i>diplopia</i>, or double sight in each eye.
Instead of a single needle and thread, she saw four continually
at work, everything else about her being similarly
multiplied. At first she took no notice of the singular
illusion, but at last both imagination and sight
joined arms against the judgment, and the poor creature
imagined that Providence had taken pity on her
forlorn condition, and had worked a miracle in her
favour by bestowing on her four pair of hands in
order that she might do four times her usual amount of
work.</p>

<p class='c021'>The following is another instance of the passage of
illusion into hallucination. A man fifty-two years old,
of a plethoric constitution, after having suffered from a
defect in his visual functions that caused him to see objects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>sometimes double, and at others upside down, suddenly
showed signs of cerebral congestion, and threatened
apoplexy. By proper treatment, however, he was
saved for a time from the latter catastrophe, but he became
permanently afflicted with strabismus, or squinting,
and he suffered from a singular hallucination. His
eyelids would contract, and his eyeballs would roll from
side to side at more or less distant intervals. On these
occasions he imagined he saw the figures of different
persons that he knew moving about, and would even
follow them outside his door into the other rooms of the
house. He was perfectly aware that these appearances
were merely the effect of the imagination, but this did
not in any way detract from their appearance of reality.
The man afterwards died from an attack of apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c021'>The following examples are also cases of singular
optical deception, some of them being so extraordinary
as to trench upon the supernatural, and in the days of
ignorance would have given those who were their victims
the character of unearthly personages.</p>

<p class='c021'>A certain English painter, who in some sort inherited
the palette of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and believed
himself superior in many respects to the great master,
used to boast that in one year he painted over three
hundred portraits, large and small. This fact seemed
to Wigan a physical impossibility, and he questioned
him closely as to the secret of his astonishing rapidity
of execution, for he never required more than one sitting
from his patrons. Wigan states that he saw him
paint a miniature of a well-known personage in eight
hours, which was incomparable in its fidelity to nature
and finished execution. Wigan asked him to give him
some details of the method he adopted, and he gave him
the following answer: “When a sitter presents himself,
I look at him attentively for half an hour, sketching
the outlines of his features on my canvass during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>time. I have no occasion for a longer sitting, and I
pass on to some one else. When I wish to continue
the first portrait, I take the sitter in my imagination,
and I seat him in the chair, where I see him as distinctly
as if he were really there, and I can even
heighten a tint, or soften down a clumsy form at will,
without altering the likeness. I look from time to time
at the imaginary figure, and I go on painting. I stop
now and then to examine his position, absolutely as if
the original were before me; for every time I look
towards the chair I see the sitter. This method of proceeding
has rendered me very popular; and as I have
always succeeded in catching the likeness of my patrons,
they have been simply enchanted at my sparing
them the tedious sittings exacted by other painters.
Little by little I have begun to lose the distinction between
the real and imaginary sitter, and I have often
maintained stoutly that my patrons had already sat to
me on the previous day. At last I became convinced
that it was the real sitters that I saw, and thenceforth
all became confusion. I suppose my friends took alarm
at my hallucinations, for I remember nothing of what
happened during the thirty years that I remained in the
madhouse. This long period has left no trace on my
memory, except indeed the last six months of my confinement.
It seems to me, however, that when my
friends talk of having visited me I have some vague recollection
of the fact; but it is a subject that I do not
care to pursue.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The most remarkable feature of the case is, that this
artist after a lapse of thirty years resumed his pencil,
and painted almost as well as when he was forced by
madness to abandon his art.</p>

<p class='c021'>This faculty of being able to evoke shadows, with
which to people one’s solitude, may be carried so far as
to transform real persons into phantoms. Hyacinth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Langlois, a distinguished artist, living at Rouen, tells
us that Talma, with whom he was extremely intimate,
confided to him that, whenever he went upon the stage,
he had the power, by mere force of will, to cause the
clothes and flesh of his numerous auditory to disappear,
and become transformed from living beings into so many
skeletons. When his imagination had peopled the house
with these singular phantoms, the emotion he felt was
so great that it gave his dramatic powers still greater
force, and enabled him to produce the wonderful effects
that have made his name so famous.</p>

<p class='c021'>Wigan says, that he once knew a most intelligent and
amiable man, who could at will evoke his own image.
He often laughed at seeing his second self standing before
him, the phantom appearing to laugh as heartily as
himself. This illusion was for a long time a matter of
amusement to him, but at last he became persuaded
that he was haunted by his own double. His second
self appeared to hold arguments with him continually,
and beat him frequently on various points of dispute, a
matter which mortified him excessively, as he was rather
proud of his powers of reasoning. This gentleman,
although always considered as being somewhat eccentric,
was never put under the slightest restraint, and at
last the creature of his imagination so tormented him,
that he resolved not to live through another year. He
consequently paid all his debts, arranged his affairs, and
waited pistol in hand until the clock struck twelve on
the 31st of December, and then deliberately blew out
his brains.</p>

<p class='c021'>In <i>Abercromby on the Mind</i> we read an account of
the observations made by a gentleman who was the victim
of illusions during the whole of a pretty long life.
If he met a friend in the street, he was unable to tell
at first whether he saw a real human being or only a
phantom. By close examination he could detect a difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>between the real person and the creature of his
imagination, the features of the former being sharper
and more defined than those of the phantom; but in
general he was obliged to test the reality of the figure
he saw by the senses of touch and hearing. He was
able, by concentrating his thoughts upon the appearance
of any friend, to call up his image; a power which
extended even to scenes that he had witnessed. Although
he could produce these hallucinations at will, he was
powerless in making them disappear; and when once
he succeeded in calling forth these creatures of his imagination,
he never could tell how long the delusion
would last. This gentleman was in the prime of life, a
good man of business, and otherwise in a perfect state
of mental and bodily health. A member of his family
possessed the same faculty, but in a minor degree.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1806, General Rapp, when returning from the
siege of Dantzic, having occasion to speak to the Emperor
Napoleon, walked into his private room without
being announced, and found him in such a profound
state of abstraction, that he remained for some time
unperceived by his imperial master. The General, seeing
him thus perfectly motionless, fancied he must be
ill, and purposely made a slight noise. Napoleon instantly
turned his head, seized the General by the arm,
and pointing upwards, exclaimed, “Do you see it up
there?” The General, hardly knowing what to say,
remained silent; but the Emperor repeated his question,
and he was obliged to reply, that he saw nothing.
“What,” said the Emperor, “you don’t see anything?
You don’t see my star shining before your eyes?” And
becoming more and more animated, he went on to say,
that the mysterious visitor had never abandoned him,
that he saw it throughout all his great battles, that it
always led him onward, and that he was never happy
but when he was gazing at it.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>That such hallucinations have no real existence as far
as the eye goes, is proved by the fact of many people
who have lost their sight, being subject to them. It is
hardly to be wondered at that those who by accident
have been deprived of their sight, should wish so
ardently to see once more the persons and sights they
have taken pleasure in, that they should at last create
for themselves illusions of this character. The same
thing has frequently occurred with those whose sight is
more or less weak. An old man of eighty, who was
purblind, never sat down to a table during the last
years of his life, without seeing around him a number
of his friends who had long been dead, dressed in the
costume of fifty years before. This old man had but
one eye, which was extremely weak, and wore a pair of
green preservers, in the glass of which he continually
saw his own face reflected.</p>

<p class='c021'>Doctor Dewar, of Stirling, mentioned to Abercromby
a very remarkable instance of this species of hallucination.
The patient, who was quite blind, never walked
in the street without seeing a little old woman hobbling
on before him and leaning on a stick. This apparition
always disappeared when he entered his house.</p>

<p class='c021'>Similar illusions frequently happen to every one, even
the most healthy amongst us, but a little consideration
soon puts them to flight. It would be useless to mention
the numberless cases in which a square tower has
appeared round, or where the landscape has suddenly
seemed to recede from the sight. Such illusions as
these have been long well known, and appreciated at
their proper value; but there are others whose true
cause has remained a mystery, until explained by the
progress of science, such as the Spectre of the Brocken,
the Fata Morgana, and the mirage.</p>

<p class='c021'>Analogous appearances have been seen in Westmoreland
and other mountainous districts, the inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>imagining that the air was full of troops of cavalry, and
whole armies even; such illusions resulting simply from
the shadows of men and horses passing over an opposite
mountain being thrown on the fog.</p>

<p class='c021'>A vast number of different circumstances give rise to
these illusions, such as a strong impression, or the recollection
of some striking event, which may easily
cause them, by the association of ideas. Wigan relates,
that being at a <i>soirée</i> held at the house of M. Bellart,
a few days after the execution of Marshal Ney, the
groom of the chamber, instead of calling out the name
of <i>M. Maréchal aîné</i> (M. Maréchal, senior), announced
the arrival of M. le Maréchal Ney. A shudder passed
through the company, and many of them declared, that
for an instant they saw the face and figure of the dead
man in place of those of his involuntary representative.</p>

<p class='c021'>When the mind is thus prepared, the most familiar
objects are transformed into phantoms. Ellis relates
an anecdote of this kind, which he heard from an eye-witness,
who was a ship’s captain of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
During a voyage that he made, the ship’s cook died.
Some days after the funeral, the chief mate came running
to him in a great fright, with the news that the
ship’s cook was walking on the water, astern of the
vessel, and that all the crew were on deck looking at
him. The captain, who was angry at being disturbed
with so nonsensical a tale, answered sharply, that they
had better put the ship about and race the ghost to
Newcastle. His curiosity, however, was presently
aroused, and he went upon deck and looked at the spectre.
He frankly avowed that for some moments he saw
what really appeared to be his old shipmate, just as he
knew him in life, with his walk, clothes, cap and figure
perfectly resembling those of the dead man. The panic
became general, and every one was struck motionless
for a time. He had the presence of mind, however, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>seize the helm and put the ship about, when as they
neared the ghost, they found the absurd cause of their
fright was a broken mast from some wreck, which was
floating after them in an upright position. If the captain
had not boldly sailed up to the supposed ghost, the
story of the dead cook walking upon the water would
have continued to this day to terrify half the good inhabitants
of Newcastle.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such facts as these are innumerable, and we shall
mention a few more which will explain a host of stories
found in various ancient and modern authors.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ajax was so angry at the arms of Achilles being
awarded to Ulysses, that he became furious, and, seeing
a herd of pigs, drew his sword and fell upon them,
taking them for Greeks. He next seized a couple of
them and beat them cruelly, loading them at the same
time with insults, imagining one of them to be Agamemnon,
his judge, and the other Ulysses, his enemy.
When he came to himself, he was so ashamed at what
he had done, that he stabbed himself with his sword.</p>

<p class='c021'>Theodoric, blinded by jealousy and yielding to the
base solicitations of his courtiers, ordered that Symmachus,
one of the most upright men of his time, should
be put to death. The cruel order had hardly been executed,
when the king was seized with remorse, and
bitterly reproached himself with his crime. One day a
new kind of fish was put upon the table, when the king
suddenly cried out that he saw in the head of the fish
the absolute resemblance of that of his victim. This
vision had the effect of plunging the king into a state
of melancholy that lasted his whole life.</p>

<p class='c021'>Bessus once, when surrounded by his guests and giving
himself up to the enjoyment of the feast, ceased
suddenly to listen to the flattering speeches of his courtiers.
He apparently listened with great attention to
some sound that was heard by no one else, and suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>leaping from his couch, mad with rage, he seized his
sword and rushing at a swallow’s nest that was near,
beat it down, killing the poor birds inside it, crying out
that these insolent birds dared to reproach him with the
murder of his father. Surprised at such a sight, his
courtiers gradually disappeared, and it became known
some time afterwards that Bessus was really guilty, and
that the senseless action he had performed simply resulted
from the voice of conscience.</p>

<p class='c021'>The illusions of sight and hearing are often found to
take an epidemic form, and historians relate an immense
number of anecdotes bearing on this particular phase of
self-delusion. One of the commonest of them is that
which transforms the clouds into armies and figures of
all kinds. Religious prejudices, optical phenomena,
physical laws that are still unknown, dangerous fevers,
derangements of the brain, afford a natural explanation
of these hallucinations.</p>

<p class='c021'>We have borrowed most of these examples from
Brière de Boismont’s works, for the special purpose of
showing how easy it is to deceive the imagination, and
to demonstrate the facility with which the sense of sight
is led astray without the intervention of complicated
apparatus. In addition, we may quote instances from
Brewster, showing the ease with which the imagination
enables us to see distinct forms in a confused mass of
flames, or in a number of shadows superposed upon each
other. This great philosopher gives us an anecdote of
Peter Heamann, a Swedish pirate and murderer. One
day that his crew were repairing some unimportant
portion of the ship, after having pitched the place well
he took the brush in order to tar the other parts of
the vessel, which were much in want of such treatment;
but as soon as he spread the pitch over the timbers of
the ship, he was thunderstruck at seeing apparently
reflected in its shining surface the image of a gallows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>with a headless man beneath. The head belonging to
the body was lying before it, and the body itself was
depicted with every limb—legs, thighs, and arms—perfect.
He frequently told his crew of these illusions,
adding that it was evidently a prediction of the fate in
store for them. He was often in such a state of terror,
that on calm days he would drop down into the hold
and wrap himself up in a spare sail in order not to
catch sight of the horrible image that he constantly saw
in the shining surface of the tar.</p>

<p class='c021'>The imagination really seems to create for itself a sort
of mental visual organ which is in intimate relation
with that of the body, and which often takes its place
so efficiently—as in the case of dreams—that the mind
is utterly unable to perceive the substitution. It is on
account of this that practical opticians are so unsparing
in their endeavours to predispose their spectators to
being deceived.</p>

<p class='c021'>When both the body and mind are healthy, the relative
intensity of the two kinds of impressions is very
unequally divided, mental images being more evanescent
and comparatively weak, and with persons of ordinary
temperament incapable of effacing or disturbing the
reflections of visible objects. The affairs of life could
not go on if the memory introduced amongst them brilliant
representations of the past in the midst of ordinary
domestic scenes or the objects familiar to us. We may
account for this by supposing that the set of nerves
which carries the efforts of the memory to the brain
cannot execute their functions at the same time as those
which take cognizance of the images reflected on the
retina. In other words, the mind cannot accomplish
two separate functions at one and the same time, and
the mere act of directing the attention to one class of
subjects causes all others to become instantly imperceptible.
The exercise of the mind in these instances is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>however, so rapid that the alternate appearance and
disappearance of the two different impressions is completely
unnoticed. Thus, for instance, while looking at
the dome of St. Paul’s, if our memory suddenly evokes
the image of some other object, Mont Blanc for instance,
the picture of the cathedral, although still depicted on
our retina, is momentarily effaced by the effort of the
will, although we may not change the position of our
eyes during the time. While the memory continues
to dwell on the picture it has called up, it is seen
with sufficient distinctness, although its details may
be somewhat misty and its colours confused; but as
soon as the wish to see it passes away the whole
disappears, and the cathedral is seen in all its former
distinctness.</p>

<p class='c021'>In darkness and solitude, when surrounding objects
produce no images that can interfere with those of the
mind, these latter are more lively and distinct: and
when in addition we are half asleep and half awake,
the intensity of mental impressions approaches that of
visible objects. In the case of persons of studious
habits who are continually employed in mental effort,
these images are more distinct than with those who
follow the ordinary avocations of life, and during their
working hours rarely see the objects round them. The
earnest thinker, absorbed by meditation, is in a manner
deprived for the time of the use of his senses. His
children and servants pass in and out of his study
without his seeing them, they speak to him without
his hearing them and they may even try to rouse
him from his reverie without success; and yet his
eyes, ears, and nerves received the impression of light,
sound, and touch. In such instances, the mind of the
philosopher is voluntarily occupied in following out an
idea which interests him profoundly; but even the most
unlearned and thoughtless of us sees the images of dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>or absent friends with his mind’s eye, or even fantastic
figures which have nothing to do with the train of
thought he may be pursuing. It is with these involuntary
apparitions as with spectres of the imagination:
although they are intimately connected with some
thought that has passed through our mind unperceived,
it is impossible to trace a single link of the chain connecting
them together.</p>

  <h2 id='ch2-01' class='c012'>CHAPTER I.<br /><span class='c020'>WHAT IS LIGHT?</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Everybody</span> knows the effects of the action of light,
without, however, understanding precisely what constitutes
light itself. Any formal definition would rather
puzzle than help the student; we must therefore content
ourselves with saying that light is that effect of
force which causes us to perceive external objects.</p>

<p class='c021'>A man who was blind from his birth, and upon whom
the operation for cataract had been successfully performed,
had accustomed himself for a long time to imagine
the nature of those unknown phenomena that his
affliction had prevented him from observing. He had
arranged in his mind the various definitions that had
been given to him as to the nature of light, and having
combined them, he fancied he had acquired some notion
of what the sense of vision really meant. But what
was the astonishment of the surgeon who had restored
to him his fifth sense, when he asked him to give his
opinion upon the effects of light, to see him take up a
lump of sugar and reply that it was under that form
that he had imagined it to himself.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>As for us who have the happiness of possessing the
sense of sight, we know this mysterious agent more by
the enjoyment that we have derived from it, than from
any analysis we have made of its nature. It is an endless
chain that connects us with the entire universe; a
bond that laughs at distance and spans the abysses of
space. By means of light we can appreciate the beauties
of hue and form, and by its power we touch as it
were the inaccessible. It constitutes the most intimate
connexion between ourselves and external objects—a
connexion that seems even to alter our temper, disposition,
and character, according to the variations of its
intensity. The dull and foggy days of winter, those
days when sleet and rain struggle in the atmosphere,
spread like a veil over us, and throw a shadow upon
our life. The return of the bright spring sun, the reappearance
of light and blue sky, on the contrary, open
up our hearts and minds, gay nature enchants us once
more, and a feeling of fresh happiness prepares us for
the coming glories of the newly risen year.</p>

<p class='c021'>This intimate connexion between the light of heaven
and the human mind, hallowed as it is by our desire to
rise towards the Source of all light, might be made the
subject of many eloquent pages; and it would be an
interesting and useful task to show the gradual progress
of mankind from those ancient people who trembled
at the approach of darkness, and who fervently
saluted the dawn with prayers and praises, down to the
philosophers of the present age, who investigate its
effects with so much reverential joy. But we must
cease paying any more attention to the superficial action
of this marvellous force which in these latter days
has become, in the hands of man, the source of so
many illusions and the origin of a complete world of
rich and brilliant pictures, but which after all only exist
in the imagination.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>It was believed for a long time that light was a compact
mass of tiny particles emitted by luminous bodies,
which struck our eyes and so produced the phenomenon
of vision. These particles or molecules were naturally
thought to be extremely minute, and the objects illuminated
by them were supposed to throw them off as
if they were endowed with elasticity. Under this hypothesis,
light was a material body. The illustrious
Newton was the first propagator of this theory; the
last was M. Biot, a French philosopher, lately dead.</p>

<p class='c021'>The undulatory theory has now-a-days completely
superseded the corpuscular hypothesis. It was first
started about the year 1660 by the Dutch philosopher
Huyghens, who has left behind him numerous treatises
on optics, and the properties of light, as well as a curious
account of the inhabitants of the other members of
the solar system, including a minute description of the
various planetary manners and customs. At the beginning
of the present century, Fresnel showed, by the
most brilliant discoveries the superiority of this theory,
and shortly after Arago confirmed him in his demonstrations.
According to the undulatory hypothesis,
light is not a mass of molecules emitted by a luminous
body, but simply the vibration of an elastic fluid which
is conceived to fill the whole of space. A comparative
example may assist you in understanding this theory
more clearly. If you throw a stone into a smooth
piece of water, there will form around the point where
the stone fell, a series of circular undulations, starting
from the centre and gradually enlarging themselves.
If a loud noise is suddenly heard, the same effect is
produced round the point from whence the sound proceeds.
A series of waves are formed which spread not
only horizontally, as on the surface of the water disturbed
by the stone, but in every direction. In fact,
in the case of sounds, the waves are so many gradually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>increasing spheres. In the case of light, when a luminous
body is placed in space, the ether which surrounds
it is thrown into a state of vibration, and the motion is
immediately propagated in all directions, with extreme
velocity. It is these undulations that produce upon our
eyes the sensation of light. We may therefore say that
light, like sound, is movement, while darkness, like silence,
is absolute rest.</p>

<p class='c021'>Many people still believe that light is propagated instantaneously,
and cannot bring themselves to imagine
that we do not see a flame the moment we light it, but
only an instant after. I have myself spoken to well-educated
people possessed of good judgment and a certain
amount of elementary knowledge, who could never
bring themselves to believe that we see the stars, not as
they now exist, but as they appeared at the particular
moment when the luminous wave by which we are enabled
to perceive them left their surface, and which only
reaches us after travelling through space a certain number
of years, days, or hours, according to their distance.
It is extremely useful and interesting to form a correct
idea upon the way in which light is propagated.</p>

<p class='c021'>The determination of the prodigious quickness with
which the waves of light move through space, says
Arago, is undoubtedly one of the happiest results of
modern astronomy. The ancients believed that it moved
with infinite velocity, and their view of the subject was
not, like so many of the questions relating to physics, a
mere opinion without proof; for Aristotle, in mentioning
it, brings forward the apparently instantaneous
transmission of daylight. This notion was disputed by
Alhazen, in his <i>Treatise on Optics</i>, but only by meta-physical
weapons, which were again opposed by several
very worthless arguments, by his commentator, Porta,
although he admitted the immateriality of light. Galileo
seems to have been the first amongst modern philosophers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>who endeavoured to determine the velocity of
light by experiment. In the first of his dialogues, <i>Delle
Scienze Nuove</i>, he announces by the mouth of Salviati,
one of the speakers present, the ingenious means he
had employed, and which he thought quite sufficient to
solve the question. Two observers with lights were
placed at the distance of one mile from each other; one
of them extinguished his light, and the other as soon as
he perceived it extinguished his. But as the first observer
saw the second light disappear the instant he
had extinguished his own, Galileo concluded that light
was propagated instantaneously through a distance double
that which separated the two observers. Certain
analogous experiments that were made by the members
of the Academy <i>Del Cimento</i>, but at three times the
distance, led to precisely the same conclusions.</p>

<p class='c021'>These attempted proofs seem at first sight to be absurd,
when we think of the vastness of the problem to
be solved; but we must judge these experiments with
less severity, when we consider that almost at the same
epoch, men of such well-deserved repute as Lord Bacon
believed that the velocity of light, like that of sound,
was sensibly altered by the force and direction of the
wind.</p>

<p class='c021'>Descartes, whose theories upon light had so much
analogy with those known under the name of the undulatory
hypothesis, believed that light was transmitted
instantaneously throughout any distance, and endeavours
to prove his position by proofs that he thought he
had obtained whilst observing an eclipse of the moon.
It must be acknowledged, however, that his very ingenious
train of reasoning proves that whether the transmission
of light is instantaneous or not, it is at least too
considerable to be determined by experiments made on
the earth, like those of Galileo, and which he vainly
hoped would have solved the question.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The frequent occultations of the first satellite of Jupiter,
the discovery of which was almost consequent
upon that of lenses, furnished Römer with the first
means of demonstrating that light was propagated by
perceptible degrees.</p>

<p class='c021'>In tracing out the history of human knowledge, says
Dr. Lardner, we have frequently to point out with some
little surprise, joined to a feeling of profound humility,
the important part played by chance in the advancement
of science. In searching zealously after mere trifles
which, when found, are of no consequence, we frequently
lay our hands on inestimable treasures. The frequency
of this fact impresses the mind with the notion that some
secret and unceasing power exists, in accordance with
which human knowledge and science are continually
progressing. It is in physical, as in moral philosophy.
In our ignorance—like the dog mentioned by Æsop,
which, seeing in the water the reflection of the prey it
held in its mouth, dropped the substance and tried to
seize the shadow—we are continually searching after
trifles; but, more fortunate than the animal of whom
we have been speaking, the shadow that we try to seize
is often transformed into a rich treasure. We can say
with every confidence that “the Providence which
shapes our ends,” knows our wants better than we do
ourselves, and bestows on us the things we <i>ought to have</i>
asked for instead of those we <i>have</i> asked for. We shall
find a very simple proof of this in the history of the
discovery of the velocity of light.</p>

<p class='c021'>A short time after the invention of the telescope and
the consequent discovery of Jupiter’s satellites, Römer,
a celebrated Danish astronomer, was engaged in a series
of observations, the object of which was to determine
the time which one of these bodies took to revolve
round its planet. The method employed by Römer was
to observe the successive occultations of the satellite,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and to notice the interval that elapsed between each of
them. But it at last happened that the interval between
the two occultations, which was about forty-five
hours, became prolonged by periods of 8, 13, and 16
minutes, during that half of the year when the earth
was receding from the planet, while it became proportionally
cut short during the rest of the year. Römer
was struck by a happy idea; he suspected instantly
that the moment when he remarked the disappearance
of the satellite was not always coincident with the instant
when it really took place, but that it sometimes
appeared to happen later—that is to say, after an interval
of time sufficiently long to allow the light that
had left the satellite immediately after its disappearance,
to reach the eye of the observer. Hence it became
evident that the farther off the earth was from the
satellite, the longer was the interval of time between its
disappearance and that of the arrival of the last portions
of its light upon the earth; but that the moment of the
disappearance of the satellite is that of the commencement
of the occultation, and that the moment of the
arrival of the last portions of light is that when the
commencement of the occultation is observed.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was thus that Römer explained the difference between
the calculated and observed time of the occultation,
and he saw that he was on the threshold of a
great discovery. In a word, he saw that light propagated
itself through space with a certain velocity, and
that the fact we have just mentioned furnished the precise
means of measuring it.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus the occultation of the satellite was retarded one
second for every 185,000 miles that the earth is
distant from Jupiter; the reason being, that a ray of
light takes a second to travel this distance, or, in other
words, because the velocity of light is at the rate of
185,000 miles per second.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>It must be remembered when considering this subject,
that in any system of undulations or vibrations, no
matter through what medium they are propagated, their
movement is simply a change of form, and not a transmission
of matter. The waves which spread round a
central point when a stone is thrown into the water,
give one the idea that the water which forms the wave
really moves towards the observer. But it is not so, as
may be readily proved by placing on the surface a floating
body, which we shall find is but little, if at all, influenced
by the undulations of the water. The appearance
of rolling waves given on the stage by means of a painted
cloth, to which an undulatory motion is given, is an instance
of this apparent movement. In the case of the
floating body, which would follow the movements of the
water, we shall find that wave after wave rolls to the
shore, in the same way as the painted marks on the
imitation sea keep their place, although the cloth itself
undulates. The waves of the sea even appear to the eye
to be endowed with a progressive motion, but an instant’s
observation will convince us of our error; for if such
were the case, every object floating on the ocean would
be gradually carried on shore. A vessel floating on the
waves is not carried along by them, at least not until it
reaches within a few yards of the shore, where the
water is really in motion; but out in the open sea a
floating body will alternately rise on their crests, and
fall into the valleys that separate them. The same
effect may be observed with any object floating on the
water. If, however, in addition to being in a state of
undulation the sea is really in motion from the effects
of a current, or from any other cause, the floating
object will of course be carried along by it—in fact, the
two movements are quite independent of each other,
and may take place in similar or contrary directions.
It is very important that we should be able to distinguish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>at an early period the exact difference between
true movement and mere undulation; and we must remember
that although the waves of light are propagated
at the rate of 185,000 miles a second, still there
is no transmission of any material substance at this
marvellous rate. The same observation applies to
sonorous vibrations transmitted through the air.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus we are constrained to admit peaceably the truth
of the undulatory hypothesis as compared with the corpuscular
theory. I say <i>peaceably</i>, because I am forcibly
reminded by the contrast I have made between the two
theories of an anecdote related of one of the greatest
monsters who ever walked this earth, but who was afterwards
struck down in the midst of his power by the
hand of a weak girl. I allude to the infamous Marat,
who one day presented himself at the house of Dr.
Charles, a celebrated natural philosopher, of the time of
the first French Republic, in order to advance certain
notions of his own against the optical principles that
Newton has left behind in his <i>Principia</i>, and other
works—also, to oppose certain theories connected with
electrical science. Dr. Charles, who did not approve of
Marat’s wild notions, undertook to convince him of his
errors. But instead of discussing the matter peaceably,
Marat allowed himself to be carried away by his temper,
which was naturally very violent. Every argument advanced
by his antagonist seemed to increase his rage,
until at last he lost all control over himself, drew his
small sword, and rushed upon his opponent. The doctor,
who was unarmed, had to exercise all his powers to prevent
himself from being wounded, and being much more
stoutly built than Marat, he at last succeeded in throwing
him down, and wresting his sword from him, which he
immediately took care to break. Whether it was the
violence of the fall, the shame he felt at being doubly
beaten, or the effects of his fit of passion, does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>appear, but Marat fainted. Assistance was called, and
he was carried home to his house, his offence against all
the laws of propriety being forgiven by his more talented
and better-tempered adversary.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are many persons, no doubt, whom we should
astonish, and possibly enrage, by asserting positively
that we could cause darkness by means of light, that
silence could be produced by sound, or cold by heat.
These are daring paradoxes, and at first sight appear
almost as reasonable as that of Anaxagoras, a Greek
philosopher, who asserted that snow was black. But as
I hope that most of my readers do not possess the
passionate temper of the French tribune, I will confide
to them a little secret that will make these paradoxes
plain. It is called by natural philosophers the theory
of interference.</p>

<p class='c021'>The experiments connected with this subject are
exceedingly difficult to perform, and require the aid of
apparatus far beyond the reach of the ordinary student.
It is a case where theory and description are much easier
than practice.</p>

<p class='c021'>If a ray of electric light is thrown upon a screen, it is
possible to direct another ray upon the same spot in
such a manner that they will extinguish each other
mutually. The reason of this phenomenon may be
understood, if we remember that light is caused by
undulatory movement, and that by opposing two series
of waves to each other in such a manner that their
vibrations coming in contact produce rest, we can easily
see how the waves of light of one ray may be stopped
by those of a second.</p>

<p class='c021'>Going back to our illustration of the eddies on a
pool of water, it is easy to prove that by throwing
a second stone into the water we form another series
of undulations; which are mutually destroyed when
they encounter each other. It is the same with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>peculiar fluid which, existing throughout space, is
thrown in a state of undulation by incandescent bodies;
by opposing one set of waves to another we obtain rest
as a result.</p>

<p class='c021'>This fact was first observed by Grimaldi in 1665, and
Dr. Thomas Young was the first to offer an explanation.
Fresnel used it with great success at the beginning of
the century to demonstrate the truth of the undulatory
theory, by showing that it could not be explained by
any other.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> white light that the glorious orb of day spreads
over the face of nature is the original source of all those
brilliant and sombre colours with which the works of
the Creator are beautified. To the rays of the sun we
owe not only the whiteness of the lily, but the scarlet of
the field poppy, the modest blue of the timid violet, the
splendour of the peacock’s plumage, the cool green of
the meadows, and the purple and gold of the distant
mountains. For, as we have hinted before, this white
light, which seems of itself so destitute of colour, is
productive of every hue that the eye of man is capable
of appreciating.</p>

<p class='c021'>It may seem that I am bestowing too much praise
upon our own sun; but if you are surprised that I
should seek to exalt this brilliant globe of ever-burning
fire, I must ask you to recollect, that though the starry
heavens are full of suns as vast and important as ours,
and possibly affording brilliant colourless light to worlds
full of inhabitants, there are others that give forth rays
that are far from being white. Some are as green as
emeralds, others are as blue as sapphires, while others
give out a warm light like a ruby or topaz. The worlds
which surround these can only receive light of a certain
colour, or at any rate they are restricted to a few shades
and hues. Imagine living in a world where everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>was always <i>couleur de rose</i>, or in which the inhabitants
were continually looking blue! A residence in either
of them for a short time would undoubtedly cause us to
appreciate the relative value of our own little sun, small
as it is in comparison with some of the mighty orbs
floating about in space.</p>

<p class='c021'>The fact that the light of the sun is the source of all
the changing hues to be found on the surface of the
earth season after season was first discovered by Newton,
and his experiments are easily repeated with a very few
and inexpensive appliances.</p>

<p class='c021'>A small round hole is made in the window-shutter of
a room, facing the sun, and the pencil of light proceeding
from it is allowed to fall upon the surface of a three-sided
prism, held in a horizontal position, and placed
at a distance of a few inches from the aperture (<a href='#i004b'>fig. 5</a>,
Frontispiece). The pencil of light does not pass through
the prism as if it were a plate of glass with parallel
sides, but in virtue of the laws of refraction, of which
we have already spoken, it is turned out of its natural
course, and is thrown upon the wall in the direction indicated
in the figure. The pencil of light is not only
turned aside, but it is also widened out into a band
which is truly painted with all the colours of the rainbow,
every tone and hue being of the most marvellous
brilliancy. This long coloured stripe, which constitutes
one of the most beautiful sights that the science of
optics can afford us, is known to scientific men by the
name of the solar spectrum.</p>

<p class='c021'>Before going into the causes that produce these
colours, let us first examine their number and position.
Beginning at the top, we shall find that they run in the
following order:—Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow,
orange, red. The red being lowest is called the least
refrangible of them all; or, in other words, in passing
through the prism it was bent less out of its course than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>its companions. Violet, being at the top, is of course
the most refrangible. The cause of the separation of
the colours of white light is consequently only the effect
of their individual character. They were, so to speak,
so many streams flowing together until an unexpected
deviation in their course caused them to separate. This
change in the direction of their flow brought out their
personal individuality, and they at once became completely
disunited.</p>

<p class='c021'>Every single tint in the prismatic spectrum is simple,
and cannot be decomposed. This may be shown by
passing any of them through another prism, when it
will be found that no change will take place in the
colour or size of the pencil. Hence those worlds already
spoken of, whose light of day is red, blue, or green,
never see any colours but these. (<a href='#i004a'>Fig. 6</a>, Frontispiece).</p>

<p class='c021'>It is just as easy to reunite the colours into which
white light is decomposed, by applying a second prism
in a reversed position to the pencil of coloured light, as
it is to separate them in the first instance. The method
of accomplishing this is shown in <a href='#i004c'>fig. 7</a>, Frontispiece.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 8.</span>—The Recomposition of Light.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Another experiment in the same direction consists in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>reuniting the colours by causing them to pass through
a double convex lens, behind which is placed a screen
of ground glass, or a card (<a href='#i086'>fig. 8</a>). By advancing and
withdrawing this screen we can easily find the exact
spot where the rays reunite, and form a dazzling spot
of white light. This point is called the focus, from a
Latin word, signifying “fire-place,” a term which will
put the student in mind of the frequently repeated experiment
of burning a piece of paper with an ordinary magnifying-glass.</p>

<p class='c021'>Instead of using a lens, you can, if you please, employ
a concave mirror, using the ground glass or cardboard
screen, as before. The colours reflected by the
mirror unite at its focus, and produce a brilliant white
spot in just as conclusive a manner as in the other experiment.</p>

<div id='i087'  class='figcenter id010'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 9.—Recomposition of Light by means of a Concave Mirror.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>A fourth experiment, which is somewhat more difficult
for the student to accomplish, consists in causing
every one of the seven different colours to be reflected
from a separate mirror.</p>

<p class='c021'>The mirrors in this case are concave, and are so
mounted as to be capable of being moved in any direction.
By directing each of the seven rays, one by one,
upon the same point, you may observe the gradual decomposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of the coloured light. The effect obtained
by adding the last colour to the mixture is quite magical,
the white circle being produced from two brilliantly-coloured
spots.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 10.—Recomposition of Light by means of a number of Mirrors.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>A fifth experiment, first devised by Newton, is also
within the reach of the student. On a disc of cardboard
the centre and border of which have been previously
painted black, are pasted seven strips of paper, painted
as nearly as possible of the same colour as the components
of the spectrum—or if the student is anything
of an artist he may paint the disc in imitation of the
spectrum, carefully shading off the tints into each other.
If the disc be now rapidly rotated the colours will disappear,
and a greyish hue will be seen, which will approach
more closely to white, the nearer the colours on
the disc are to those of the spectrum. This experiment
is not precisely the same in principle as the preceding
ones, for it is evident that the colours on the disc do
not mix, but only the impressions they form upon the
retina. We have already said that such impressions
remain on the eye for one-tenth of a second or there-abouts;
the disc must therefore revolve at least ten
times a second, or the effect will not be perceived.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 11.</span>—Newton’s Disc.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>From these experiments it follows that the colours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>with which all natural substances are clothed, ought not
to be looked upon as belonging to them absolutely, but
only as a property dependent on the reflection and
absorption of light from their surfaces. The leaves of
plants, for instance, must not be regarded as being
really green in themselves, but as being capable of absorbing
certain portions of light, and reflecting others.
Grown in the dark, the green substance contained in the
plant and its leaves becomes white, and no longer possesses
the property of absorbing red light, and reflecting
green. A green leaf placed in red light becomes almost
black, from its power of absorbing light of that
colour; in the blue it reflects a much greater proportion
of the coloured ray. A very striking experiment may
be performed with a substance known to chemists as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>iodide of mercury. If a little of this salt, which is of a
brilliant red, be placed in a watch-glass, and heated over
a spirit-lamp, it will gradually sublime, and a card held
over it will be covered with a number of light yellow
crystals. In this case no change of composition has
taken place, but simply a change in the power the salt
possesses of reflecting some rays and absorbing others.
By simply scratching the surface of the card with a
pointed piece of wood, the yellow crystals become transformed
once more into the red variety; not only this,
the transformation gradually spreads, like a red cloud,
over the whole of the deposit. There are some other
salts known to chemists which possess the property of
dichroism, or double colour. The double cyanide of
platinum and barium, for instance, appears violet when
viewed in one direction, and yellow in another. Change
of temperature is often sufficient to change the colour of
bodies—white oxide of zinc, for example, becomes bright
yellow when heated. Such instances might be supplied
<i>ad infinitum</i>, but enough has been said to prove that
colour, after all, is only an appearance, and not an essential
property of bodies.</p>

<p class='c021'>We have already spoken of complementary colours,
or those which it is necessary to add together in order to
produce white light. Blue, for instance, is complementary
to orange, red to green, violet to yellow, and <i>vice
versa</i>. But it is not by the aid of the palette that this
can be proved, for in the case of coloured pigments the
arrangement of their atoms interferes in some way with
the success of the experiment, and it is only by means
of the colours of the spectrum that such recompositions
can be effected.</p>

<p class='c021'>Although most philosophers consider that there are
seven colours in the spectrum, there are others who do
not admit it, but assert that there are really only three,
red, yellow and blue—which by the superposition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>their edges produce the intermediate hues of green and
orange. Perhaps it would be nearer to the truth to say
that the spectrum is composed of an infinite number of
colours of different hues.</p>

<p class='c021'>We have already stated that every one of these
colours is indecomposable, and that there are certain
worlds illuminated by a single colour only, instead of
possessing the infinite number of tints enjoyed by the
inhabitants of the solar system. An idea of this effect
can easily be gained in a very simple but surprising
manner by inserting panes of glass of different colours
in the hole of the shutter of a dark room. If the light
is yellow, you will find that all those objects that are
capable of reflecting yellow light are coloured by it,
while those which are bright red or blue become almost
black by absorbing the only light present. If we could
procure an object which was perfectly complementary
in colour to the yellow glass, it would appear perfectly
black. The same experiment may be repeated with
the other colours. After remaining in this coloured
light for some time, if you suddenly pass out into daylight
the complementary colour will tinge everything
around you.</p>

<p class='c021'>Instead of using a room into which coloured light
only is admitted, lamps burning with a coloured flame
may be employed. Brewster mentions the following
experiment, which is a very striking one:—Fill a spirit-lamp
with alcohol in which has been dissolved as much
common salt as the spirit will take up; on being lit it
will be found to burn with a livid yellow flame. A
room lighted entirely with one or two lamps of this
kind will form a laboratory for some very singular experiments.
It should, if possible, be hung with pictures
in water and oil colours, and the persons present ought
to wear nothing but the brightest colours, and the table
be ornamented with the gayest of flowers. The room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>being first lighted with ordinary daylight, the lamps
above mentioned should be brought in, and the daylight
carefully excluded, when an astonishing metamorphosis
will take place. The spectators will be hardly
able to recognise each other; the furniture of the room,
and every other object contained in it, will reflect but a
single colour. The flowers will lose their brilliant
tints, the paintings will appear as if they were drawn
in Indian ink. The brightest purple, the purest lilac,
the richest blue, the liveliest green, will be converted
into a monotonous yellow. The same change will take
place in the countenances of those present; a livid
paleness will spread over their faces, whether young or
old, and those who are naturally of an olive complexion
will hardly appear changed at all. Every one will
laugh at the appearance of his neighbour’s face, without
thinking that he is just as great a subject of laughter to
them. If, in the midst of the amusement caused by this
experiment, the light of day is admitted at one end of
the room, the other end being still lighted with the
salt-lamp, every one will appear to be half-illuminated
with the livid colour which has caused so much surprise,
the other portion of their figure and clothes being of
the natural hue. One cheek, for instance, will appear
animated with its usual brilliancy, while the other will
be that of a corpse; one side of a lady’s dress will be
brilliant blue or green, as the case may be, the other a
colour that it would puzzle an artist to give a name to.
The experiment may be varied by admitting the white
light through several small holes in the shutter of the
room, every luminous spot painting the place where it
falls in its natural colours, and the yellow spectators
will become spotted with the most singular tints and
hues. If a magic lantern is used to throw on the walls
of the room and the clothes of the company any luminous
figures, such as those of flowers or animals, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>will be coloured with these figures in the tint of the
wall or fabric upon which they fall, yellowish colours
of course escaping the transformation. If nitrate of
strontia be substituted for the salt, a crimson tint will
be spread over everything. In fact, a lamp prepared
in this way will form a source of endless amusement.
It is not necessary to use alcohol for the purpose;
wood-spirit or methylated alcohol will serve the purpose
equally well. If a lamp is not to be had, a few pieces
of cotton-wool, tied on wires and dipped in the salted
spirit, will do almost as well.</p>

  <h2 id='ch2-03' class='c012'>CHAPTER III.<br /><span class='c020'>OTHER CAUSES OF COLOUR.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> colours of the spectrum are to the sense of sight
what the tones of the gamut are to the sense of hearing.
On the one hand, the differences in the lengths
of the sonorous waves constitute the variety of note perceptible
by the ear; on the other, the differences in the
lengths of the luminous waves constitute the variety of
colour perceptible by the eye. By and by, we shall
learn both the length and rapidity of these vibrations,
but it will be as well first to describe the experiments
made in this direction by the immortal Newton
himself.</p>

<p class='c021'>Every one has, doubtless, at one period of his life,
amused himself with blowing soap-bubbles by means of
a tobacco-pipe and a little lather—a sufficiently childish
amusement, you will possibly say, but one narrowly
connected with the most intricate secrets of the science
of optics. These little globes, so fragile that they disappear
in a breath, hardly seem worthy of the attention
of a thinker, and still less the examination of a philosopher;
but it is nevertheless true that Newton made experiments
on the colours shown on the surface of these
apparently insignificant objects which ended in the
most brilliant discoveries, just as on seeing an apple fall
he began a train of thought which only terminated in
the enunciation of the hypothesis of the earth’s power
of gravity.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>All transparent substances, whether liquid, solid, or
gaseous, become coloured with the most brilliant hues
as soon as they are reduced to plates of extreme thinness.
In the soap-bubble it is the oleaginous particles
floating on the surface which thus become coloured, but
Newton showed that thin plates of air were similarly
capable of showing colour, and that the thinner the
plates were the more brilliant were the tints. We may
see this in the soap-bubble, which becomes more beautiful
as it gets larger and thinner. By placing a convex
lens of large size on a flat plate of glass, Newton
observed that rings of different colours were formed
round the spot where the two pieces of glass touched.</p>

<div id='i095'  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i095.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 12.—Newton’s Rings.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>By measuring the convexity of the lens and the diameter
of the various rings, Newton was enabled to tell to
a minute fraction the exact thickness of the plate of
air corresponding to the different colours. The glasses
being placed in position, a ray of a particular colour—red,
for instance—was thrown upon the surface. The
result was a black spot at the point where the two surfaces
touched, and surrounding it at various distances
were several rings alternately red and black. Calculating
the thickness of the plates of air at the part
where the dark rings made their appearance, Newton
found that their dimensions were in the proportion of
the even numbers two, four, six, eight, &amp;c.; while the
red rings showed figures corresponding to the odd numbers.
Although trammelled by the corpuscular theory,
Newton’s deductions from these experiments show that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>they can only be accounted for by the undulatory hypothesis.
Thus the thickness of the plate of air at the first
red ring is that of the red wave, the thickness at the
second that of two red waves, and so on; so that in order
to arrive at the thickness of the red wave we need
only measure the distance between the portions of the
glasses where the first red ring occurs.</p>

<p class='c021'>This experiment, was applied to the measurement of
all the waves. Whenever they were reflected on the
glasses a parallel series of rings was formed, but it was
found that the first ring was more or less distant from
the central spot, according to the colour used. The red
ring was the largest; the orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet, following in the same sequence as in
the spectrum. The word “thickness” seems hardly fit
to apply to dimensions arrived at by Newton in his experiments,
so infinitely small do they appear to be, yet
their correctness has never been impugned, although
the experiments have been repeated by the philosophers
of all countries. The waves of red light are so small
that 40,000 of them go to an inch, and those of violet
light situated at the other end of the spectrum are still
smaller, measuring only the 60,000th part of an inch.</p>

<p class='c021'>The waves of the other colours are between these two,
while the wave of white light, which is a mixture of
them all, is just half-way between the two.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus was the physical cause of the various hues of
colour discovered by this great man, revealing as it does
the singular and mysterious analogy between sound and
light. The rays of light, like the waves of sound, produce
a different effect, according to their length, by
causing quicker or slower pulsations in the nerves of
sight, just as musical sounds vibrate upon the drum of
the ear with different velocities.</p>

<p class='c021'>This is not all, for the relationship between sound and
light does not cease here: we have as yet only spoken
of the size of the undulations, and have only shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>how their dimensions are connected with the sensation
of colour; but there are other things to be considered,
for on investigation we find that not only do the different
coloured waves vary in the length of their undulations,
but also in the number that take place in a given
time.</p>

<p class='c021'>The perception of sound is produced by the action of
the drum of the ear, which vibrates sympathetically
with the pulsations of the air that have been originated
by the vibrations of the sounding body; and the perception
of light is produced in a similar manner by the
vibrations originating in a luminous body, and propagating
themselves through the luminous ether until
they reach the nerves of sight. The number of these
pulsations taking place in the eye has been accurately
determined in the following manner. Let us suppose
that we are looking at a coloured object—let us say, a
red railway signal-lamp; from the lamp to our eye there
flows a continuous line of luminous undulations; these
undulations enter the eye and become depicted on the
retina. For every wave that passes through the pupil,
there is a separate and corresponding vibration of the
optic nerve, and the number of these vibrations that
take place in the course of a second can be easily calculated
if we know the velocity of light and the breadth
of the waves. We have before found that light travels
at the rate of 185,000 miles per second; it therefore
follows, that a series of undulations 185,000 miles long
pass through the pupil every second; consequently the
number of vibrations per second is arrived at by calculating
how many waves measuring the 40,000th of
an inch—that being the length of a wave of red light—are
contained in 185,000 miles. The following table,
showing the number of waves passing into the eye
per second for the different colours, will interest the
student:—</p>

<p class='c024'>Whatever theory we may adopt to explain the phenomena
of light, we arrive at conclusions that strike
the mind with astonishment and admiration. According
to the corpuscular hypothesis, it was supposed that
the molecules of light were endowed with the power of
attraction and repulsion, that they possessed poles and
centres of gravity like the earth, and that they had
other physical properties that could only be given to
ponderable matter. Starting with these notions, it is
difficult to divest oneself of the idea of sensible size, or
to induce the mind to conceive particles so extremely
small as those of light would necessarily be if the theory
of emission were accepted. If a particle of light weighed
a grain, it would produce by means of its enormous velocity
the effects of a cannon-ball weighing 120 lbs.,
travelling at the rate of 300 yards per second. How
infinitely small would be these particles, seeing that the
most delicate optical instruments are submitted to their
action for years without being injured!</p>

<p class='c021'>If we are astonished at the extreme smallness and
prodigious rapidity of the luminous molecules whose
existence is necessitated by the corpuscular theory, the
numerical results of the undulatory hypothesis are not
less surprising. The extreme smallness of the distance
between the waves, and the inconceivable quickness of
their undulations, although both are easily calculated,
must raise in the mind of the student feelings of the
utmost wonder and admiration.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Colour, then, simply results from the difference in
the rate of vibration of the rays, as Professor Tyndall
observes in his lectures on the “Analogy between Sight
and Sound,” the impression of red being produced by
waves that undulate a third less rapidly than those
which produce the sensation of violet.</p>

  <h2 id='ch2-04' class='c012'>CHAPTER IV.<br /><span class='c020'>LUMINOUS, CALORIFIC, CHEMICAL, AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF THE SPECTRUM.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> solar spectrum may be compared to a battle-field
with an army drawn up upon it ready for action. In
the centre we find the luminous rays, on one side the
light troops which produce chemical effect, and on the
other the heating rays, which may be compared to squadrons
of heavy cavalry. Close by the light brigade are
the magnetic rays, which are a corps of skirmishers,
sometimes appearing, and at others hiding themselves
from view in a very mysterious manner.</p>

<p class='c021'>But to drop metaphor, we shall find on examination
of the spectrum that the three great forces—heat, light,
and chemical effect—are regularly distributed over three
different portions of this wonderful band of colour.</p>

<p class='c021'>Before Fraunhofer the intensity of the light of different
parts of the spectrum remained undetermined
with any degree of accuracy; but this philosopher, by
the use of a very delicate photometer, obtained the results
given below.</p>

<p class='c021'>The maximum of luminous effect is situated just at
the junction of the yellow and orange. Taking this
spot as its starting-point, it gradually decreases on each
side until it ceases altogether at the extreme red and
violet.</p>

<p class='c021'>With respect to the calorific portion of the spectrum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>it was for a long time supposed that the heat-giving
properties of any part were in direct proportion to the
amount of its luminous effect; but Sir John Herschel
proved by a long series of experiments that the heat of
the spectrum gradually increased from the extreme
violet to the extreme red, and that passing this point it
still further increased until it attained its maximum at
a point where not a single ray of light existed. From
these grand experiments he adduced the important conclusion,
that in solar light there existed invisible rays,
which produced heat, and which possessed even a less
degree of refrangibility than the extreme red rays. Sir
John Herschel then tried, but unsuccessfully, to determine
the exact refrangibility of the invisible heat
rays.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Henry Englefield compared these results, and
obtained the following figures:——</p>

</div>
<p class='c024'>Bérard obtained similar results, but he at first found
that the maximum of heat was just at the end of the
extreme red, and that beyond it the air was only about
one-fifth warmer than the ordinary temperature. Sir
John Herschel attributed these discordant results to
Bérard having used a thermometer with too large a
bulb; he accordingly repeated his experiments with
other instruments with long narrow bulbs, and arrived
at similar results to those obtained by the English
philosopher.</p>

<p class='c021'>We will now pass on to the physical properties of the
other end of the spectrum. Towards the end of the last
century, Scheele, a Swedish philosopher, remarked that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>chloride of silver was blackened more quickly by the
violet portion of the spectrum than by any other. In
1801, Ritter of Genoa, in repeating certain experiments
made by Herschel, found that a much stronger blackening
effect was produced at a point beyond the violet,
and that the discoloration was produced with less intensity
by the violet and still less so by the blue, the
change gradually decreasing till the red ray was reached.
He also found that when slightly blackened chloride of
silver was exposed to the effects of the red rays, or
even in the space beyond, its colour was restored to it.
From these facts he drew the conclusion that in the
solar spectrum there existed two kinds of rays, one at
the red extremity, which favoured oxygenation; the
other, at the blue end, which possessed the contrary
properties. He also found that when phosphorus was
placed in the invisible rays beyond the red, it gave off
fumes of oxide, which were immediately extinguished
when it was transferred to the other end.</p>

<p class='c021'>On repeating the experiment with chloride of silver,
Lubeck found that the tint varied according to the
colour in which it was placed. Beyond or in the violet
ray it became brownish red, in the blue it became
bluish or bluish grey, in the yellow it remained white,
or became slightly yellow and reddish in or beyond the
red ray. When he used prisms of flint glass, the chloride
of silver was discoloured beyond the visible limits
of the spectrum.</p>

<p class='c021'>Without being aware of Ritter’s experiments, Dr.
Wollaston obtained the same results by acting on
chloride of silver with violet light. In continuing his
researches he discovered that gum guaiacum was also
influenced by the chemical rays of light.</p>

<p class='c021'>The magnetic influence supposed to be exerted by the
solar rays still remains without positive proof, although
numbers of philosophers have experimented in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>direction. More than fifty years ago Dr. Morichini
announced that the violet rays of the solar spectrum
possessed the property of magnetizing steel needles
that were previously free from magnetism. He produced
this effect by concentrating the violet rays upon
one-half of each needle with a convex lens, taking care
to keep the other half concealed beneath a screen.
After having continued this experiment for more than
an hour, the needles were found to be quite magnetic.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Somerville tested Morichini’s experiments by
covering one-half of an unmagnetized needle an inch
long with a piece of paper, and exposing the uncovered
half to the violet rays of the spectrum, and found that
the needle became magnetic in the course of a couple
of hours, the exposed end being the north pole. The
indigo rays produced almost the same effect, but the
blue and green rays were much less powerful. When
the needle was exposed to the yellow, orange, red, and
invisible rays beyond the red, no magnetic effect was
produced, although the experiment was continued for
three days. Pieces of chronometer and watch springs
were submitted to the same influences with a similar
result; but when the violet rays were concentrated upon
the needles and pieces of spring with a lens, the time
necessary for magnetizing them was greatly reduced.</p>

<p class='c021'>Baumgartner of Vienna and Christie of Woolwich
also repeated these experiments. The latter philosopher
found that when a needle of magnetized steel, copper,
or even glass, vibrated by force of torsion in the rays
of the sun, the arc of vibration diminished much more
quickly than when the experiment was conducted in the
shade. The sun’s rays appeared to have the greatest
effect upon the magnetized needle. From these results
Christie concluded that the solar rays were capable of
exerting a certain amount of magnetic influence.</p>

<p class='c021'>These experiments were afterwards fully confirmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>by those of Barlocci and Zantedeschi. The former
found that a natural magnet which was capable of supporting
a pound weight, had its power almost doubled
by exposure to strong sunlight for four-and-twenty
hours. Zantedeschi exposed a magnet which would
carry fifteen ounces to the sun for three days, and increased
its power two and a half times. These experiments
seem almost to decide the fact of the power of
white and violet light to induce magnetic force; but a
series of researches by a philosopher who without doubt
is greater than any of those already mentioned, seems
to throw some doubt on the facts we have related above.</p>

<p class='c021'>Before concluding, we must add a few more facts relating
to the existence of invisible rays at both ends of
the spectrum. “The visible portion of the spectrum,”
says Dr. Tyndall, in one of his Royal Institution lectures,
“simply marks an interval of radiant action, the
rays existing in which bear such a relation to our visual
organs, as to be capable of exciting in them the sensation
of light. Beyond this interval, in both directions,
right and left, the radiant action continues to exercise
itself, but the rays emitted are dark, in consequence of
their exerting no influence on our eye. Those that exist
beyond the red ray are capable of producing heat,
while those that are beyond the violet excite chemical
action. These invisible violet rays can be actually
made perceptible to the eye, or, in other words, the undulations
or waves proceeding from this end of the
spectrum can be made to strike against certain substances
and induce luminous vibrations, so as to connect
the dark space beyond the violet with a brilliantly illuminated
band. I have here a substance capable of
effecting this change. The lower half of this sheet of
paper has been moistened with a solution of sulphate
of quinine, the other half being left in its ordinary
condition. I will now hold the paper in such a manner
that the line that separates the prepared half from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>other shall cut the spectrum in two halves horizontally.
The upper half will remain unaltered and may be
readily compared with the lower half, upon which you
will see the spectrum prolonged beyond its ordinary
limits. The effect produced is the addition of a splendid
band of fluorescent light, which extends over a space of
several inches, which but an instant before was a dark
mass. I withdraw the prepared paper, and the light
disappears; I replace it, and the light shines forth once
more; showing us in the most brilliant way that the
visible limits of the ordinary spectrum are not the limits
of radiant action.</p>

<p class='c021'>“I plunge a pencil into the solution of sulphate of
quinine, and I pass it over the paper. You see that
wherever the solution falls, the light bursts forth. The
existence of these rays has been known for a long time.
Young was familiar with them, and subjected them to
experiment; but it is to Professor Stokes that we are
indebted for a complete series of researches on this subject.
It was he who first made those invisible rays
visible, as we have done.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In the same way the Professor proceeded to show that
the heat rays were invisible by passing a beam of sunlight
through a solution of iodine in spirits of wine,
which, although it completely stopped all light, allowed
the heat rays to pass uninterruptedly. By collecting
these invisible rays into a focus by means of a lens,
Dr. Tyndall was enabled to ignite various combustible
bodies.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus we see the reason why certain rays produce
certain effects on the eye, each particular degree of refraction
causing a different set of vibrations, resulting
in a different sensation for every part of the spectrum,
and reproducing the effect of various colours on the
optic nerve. In the following chapters we shall conclude
our account of the different colours in the spectrum
and of the laws of light.</p>

  <h2 id='ch2-05' class='c012'>CHAPTER V.<br /><span class='c020'>THE LAWS OF REFLECTION.—MIRRORS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>When</span> a ray of light falls obliquely on any polished
surface, as that of a mirror, a piece of water, a plate
of burnished metal, or any other reflecting substance,
the ray, like an elastic ball, is immediately projected in
a contrary direction to that in which it fell. Moreover,
the direction in which it is reflected is at right angles
to the surface, and in the same plane as that of the ray
in the first instance. This experiment may be tried
very easily, and will show the reason for the two following
laws.</p>

<p class='c021'>1. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection,
and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>2. Reflection can only take place in one direction—in
that of the incident rays, both of which are always
in a plane perpendicular to the reflecting surface.</p>

<p class='c021'>The following figure will assist the student in performing
experiments on the reflection of light from flat
surfaces.</p>

<p class='c021'>The ray <span class='fss'>A B</span> falling obliquely on the horizontal
mirror, is reflected upwards at the same angle in the
direction <span class='fss'>B C</span>. This may be proved geometrically by
placing a graduated circle in a vertical position in the
plane <span class='fss'>A B C</span>, when we shall find that the angle <span class='fss'>A B D</span>
formed by <span class='fss'>A B</span> (the incident ray) with the perpendicular
<span class='fss'>D B</span> is equal to the angle formed by this perpendicular
line and the reflecting ray <span class='fss'>B C</span>. You may also prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in the same way that these three lines are all in the
same vertical plane.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Let us now examine the effects of light reflected
from plane surfaces. We must first, however, notice a
certain optical illusion to which we are continually
falling a prey, almost without our knowledge. We
always fancy objects to be in reality in the place where
we see them, and, in spite of our having already enumerated
a large number of these deceptions, we must
still add one more to the list. In reality we rarely see
objects in the place where they really are; for if by
the effect of reflection, refraction, or any other cause,
the rays of light are made to deviate from their course,
we no longer see the object from which they proceed in
its real position, but in the direction taken by the luminous
pencil at the moment of entering the eye.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>For instance, if the ray <span class='fss'>A B</span> is bent during its passage
to the eye at <span class='fss'>B</span>, and consequently reaches it in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>direction <span class='fss'>B C</span>, it is at <span class='fss'>A´</span>, and not at <span class='fss'>A</span>, that we shall see
the object from which it proceeds. Every ray of light
which passes out of a medium of a certain density into
another of a different density is bent from its primary
course, or, in scientific language, it is refracted. The
experiments we made in a former chapter on the
properties of the prism are founded on this principle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>The law may be easily illustrated by allowing a ray of
light to fall upon the surface of a vessel of water, as
shown in the preceding figure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>The light of the stars and planets undergoes a similar
deviation when passing in its course through the earth’s
atmosphere; and at the moment we see the rising of
the sun, the moon, or a star, they are in reality still
below the horizon. Our eyes consequently are still
deceiving us, no matter what part of the domain of optics
we may enter.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>There are two kinds of mirrors—plane and curved.
We will first examine the properties of the former sort,
being those which are ordinarily applied to the usages
of every-day life.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 17.</span>—Reflection from the Surface of Water.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In the figure in the preceding page we have a young
lady looking at her reflection in a tall cheval glass.
Every point upon the surface of her clothes and face is
reflected back to her eye from the surface of the tin
amalgam which has been applied to the back of the mirror
by the looking-glass maker, for the purpose of rendering
the image of the object more brilliant than if the
glass alone were used. The rays which proceed from
every one of these points strike upon the surface of this
metallic layer, are stopped by its opacity, and are reflected
back to the eye at an angle equal to that at which
they strike the surface. The image seen by the eye is
formed, consequently, by the reflection of every one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>these rays; and as we always see objects in the direction
taken by the luminous ray at the moment it enters
the eye, we fancy we see objects before us that are
really behind, or on each side of us. For instance, the
ray starting from the left foot of the young lady in the
figure is reflected from the point indicated on the surface
of the glass, but the eye does not stop here, but
sees the foot at an equal distance beyond the mirror.</p>

<p class='c021'>The same thing takes place, not only with glass, but
with all substances having polished surfaces. Still water,
which to all intents and purposes has a polished surface,
reflects the objects within its range as perfectly as
a mirror.</p>

<p class='c021'>The preceding observations apply to all plane reflecting
surfaces; but there are other sorts of mirrors,
whose effects are of a more interesting nature, and
which we must hasten to describe—we allude to those
whose surfaces are either convex or concave.</p>

<p class='c021'>Curved mirrors are made of a great variety of shapes,
but for the present we shall only describe those which
are spherical. Spherical mirrors may of course be
either concave or convex.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Suppose the arc <span class='fss'>M N</span> (<a href='#i111'>fig. 18</a>) to be movable round
the point <span class='fss'>O</span>, this revolution will describe the surface of
the mirror. The central point <span class='fss'>C</span> of the hollow sphere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of which the mirror forms part, is called the centre of
curvature, the line <span class='fss'>O L</span> the principal axis. By remembering
these very simple definitions, we shall be able
to understand the action of these mirrors without the
slightest difficulty.</p>

<p class='c021'>To understand how the rays of light are reflected
from the surface of the mirror <span class='fss'>N M</span> at the point <span class='fss'>F</span>, which
is called the focus, we have only to consider the mirror
as consisting of an infinite number of facets, all inclined
towards that particular point, and forming by reason of
their immense numbers a regular spherical surface. In
considering the mirror from this point of view, we can
immediately see that, on account of the inclination of
the supposed facets, the rays that they receive are all
reflected back again at the same point; and it may be
proved geometrically, that when the incident rays are
parallel the focus will be situated somewhere on the line
<span class='fss'>O C</span>, its position depending on the curvature of the
mirror.</p>

<p class='c021'>If, therefore, we receive on a spherical mirror a pencil
of sunlight, the rays which compose it may be regarded
as parallel, the sun being at so great a distance from the
earth; it follows that these rays will all be reflected
together in a particular point, viz., at <span class='fss'>F</span>, and if any
object be placed there it will be illuminated with great
brilliancy. The laws governing the reflection of heat
being nearly similar to those regulating the action of
light, the rays reflected from a burning body will ignite
any inflammable substance placed at the point <span class='fss'>F</span>. The
focus for parallel rays is called the principal focus of a
mirror. Having described the effects of parallel rays,
let us now see what happens when the source of light is
close to the mirror. If it is placed at a very small
distance, the luminous rays are divergent instead of
parallel, and their meeting point becomes changed in
accordance with the laws laid down at the beginning of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>this chapter. That is to say, the focus will approach
more or less to the centre of curvature <span class='fss'>C</span>, according as
the source of light is placed nearer to or further from the
mirror; consequently, in the case of the candle in <a href='#i113'>fig. 19</a>,
instead of uniting at <span class='fss'>F</span>, the rays will meet at <i>f</i>, a
point situated somewhat nearer the mirror than the
principal focus. If, instead of placing the light at <span class='fss'>A</span>, we
place it at <i>f</i>, we shall find the rays will be concentrated
at the point <span class='fss'>A</span>. Thus the foci are consequently related
to each other, and are hence called <i>conjugate foci</i>. It
will be readily seen that a spherical mirror may have an
infinite number of conjugate foci, according to the distance
of the source of light. It is also clear, that if we
cause the light to approach the mirror, the focus will
also approach it.</p>

<p class='c021'>Continuing our experiment, we shall find that when
the candle passes the principal focus so as to be between
it and the mirror, the reflected rays first become parallel
and then divergent, and cannot consequently produce
any focus beyond the mirror, but are reflected in the
way shown in <a href='#i115'>fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p class='c021'>In experimenting on the plane mirror, we imagined

suppose we see our reflection is called the virtual focus.</p>

the point <span class='fss'>B</span>. If, on the other hand, we place ourselves
at a distance from the principal focus, we shall produce

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> classical student will remember that Archimedes
burned the fleet of Marcellus, by means of burning-glasses,
from the heights of the fortifications of his
native city of Syracuse. Unfortunately, any account of
the system of catoptrics, or the science of reflections,
employed by the ancient Syracusan in their construction
is lost to us, and many modern writers have
gone so far as to doubt the fact altogether. The
knowledge of the properties, however, of concave
mirrors which we have just been acquiring, will enable
us to form a pretty good guess as to the means adopted
by Archimedes for the destruction of the enemy’s fleet.
The ancients, not having the means of either casting or
grinding such enormous mirrors, must have constructed
them of a large number of small ones, so arranged
that the images of the sun reflected by them would all
fall in the same place, or nearly so. In this case, the
larger the number of mirrors, the greater would be the
burning effect. In order to explain the reflection of
rays incident upon the surface of concave mirrors, we
supposed them to consist of an immense number of
plane mirrors placed in a curve, so that the reflected
rays might all meet in one point; but on examining
into the history of burning mirrors, we find that the
plan has been adopted in reality in a great number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>instances. We have also said, that the reflection of the
heating rays was governed by similar laws to those
influencing the rays of light; consequently, by directing
a pencil of sunlight upon the surface of a concave
mirror, we obtain the maximum of light and heat at
the focal point.</p>

<p class='c021'>Many modern writers give the ancients too little
credit for their knowledge of optical principles, and
late investigations seem to prove that the old school of
philosophers were much more learned in these matters
than has been generally supposed. The discovery of a
rock crystal double convex lens in an Egyptian tomb of
great antiquity is an instance of this. Descartes wrote
a little treatise to prove that the stories related of the
burning mirrors of Archimedes were pure fabrications,
although many Latin authors have described them both as
being used by that philosopher and in more modern
times; Dion, for instance, who lived in the early part
of the sixth century, states that at the siege of Constantinople,
Proclus burnt the fleet of Vitalian with
mirrors of brass; but the opinion of Descartes seemed
to outweigh all other testimony. Buffon, who wished
to sift the matter thoroughly, constructed for himself,
after many previous experiments on the laws of reflection,
a series of mirrors that closely imitated those
ascribed to Archimedes. His first memoir, “On the
Invention of Mirrors capable of burning at a great Distance,”
was published in the Transactions of the French
Academy of Sciences for 1747. A few years later he
combated both theoretically and practically the opinion
of Descartes, in a memoir containing an account of an
immense number of experiments. Before speaking of
the extraordinary effects of burning mirrors, it will be
as well to do justice to the predecessors of the learned
naturalist we have just mentioned, by quoting a passage
from the works of Father Kircher, who, 128 years previously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>experimented in this direction with great patience
and perseverance, and tried to prove that the
stories related of Archimedes were true. “The larger
the surface of a mirror,” says this philosopher (who, like
Huyghens, was a practised astronomer), “the more light
it reflects from the objects opposite to it. If it is only
a foot square, it will throw a square foot of light upon
any wall or screen placed before it. Experiment shows
that this light is composed of an infinite number of rays
reflected from different points on the surface of the mirror.
Direct the rays from a second mirror upon the
same place as those from the first, and the light and
heat will clearly be doubled. They will become trebled
if you direct the rays from a third mirror upon the
same spot, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. In order to prove
that the intensity of the light and heat is in direct proportion
to the number of reflecting surfaces employed,
I took five mirrors, and found that on exposing them to
the sun I obtained with only one, less heat and light
than if I used direct sunlight. With two the light and
heat increased considerably; three gave as much heat
as an ordinary fire, and four gave me a still greater
effect. I therefore concluded that by multiplying these
plane mirrors, I not only obtained greater effects than
those got by using parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptical mirrors,
but that I could use them upon objects at a much
greater distance. With five mirrors I could obtain
these effects at a distance of 100 feet, but what terrible
phenomena would have taken place had I used one
thousand instead of five?” He ends by begging mathematicians
to experiment in this direction with greater
care than they had hitherto done.</p>

<p class='c021'>After Kircher we may cite as an experimentalist with
these terrible instruments the French philosopher Villette,
who constructed several mirrors, in direct imitation
of those of Archimedes, for Louis XIV. and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>sovereigns. The <i>Journal des Savants</i> for 1679 gives
an account of his principal metallic burning mirror in
the most eulogistic terms, adding an instance of ignorance
which is singularly quaint and curious. It is of
the fourth and most perfect of Villette’s mirrors that
the <i>Journal des Savants</i> speaks, the first having been
bought by Tavernier, and presented to the Shah of
Persia, who considered it as one of the rarest and most
precious curiosities that he possessed: the second was
sold to the King of Denmark, and the third was given
by M. Villette to Louis XIV., from whom he received
the praises and rewards that were due to his talent and
perseverance. “It was thirty-four inches in diameter,
and vitrified flints and bricks almost instantaneously,
no matter how large they were. It consumed the greenest
wood, burning it to ashes in an instant, and fused
the most refractory metals with equal ease and quickness.
Steel, no matter how hard, resisted its power no
more than other metals, and melted so quickly that one
part burnt away in inconceivably brilliant sparks, some
of them forming stars as large as a franc piece, leaving
a flowing mass of metal behind. The last made by
Villette was still more powerful, being larger and more
carefully made. It was forty-four inches in diameter,
and three inches and a line deep. Its burning point, or
focus, was situated at a distance of three feet seven
inches from the surface, and was apparently as large as
a five-sou piece; and it was at this spot, where the rays
of light and heat were concentrated into so small a
space, that the wonderful effects of its violent power
became manifest, the spot of light being of such brilliancy
that the eyes could no more withstand its brightness
than that of the sun. Besides the property of
burning which it possessed in so wonderful a degree, it
was capable of exhibiting other effects just as curious
as those already related. It had the power of sending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the images of objects to a distance of fifteen feet or
more, so that a man looking at himself in this mirror
with a stick or sword in his hand, saw the image of them
suspended in the air, apparently ready to strike the observer.
On seeing such an effect for the first time, the
observer could hardly fail to experience the greatest
surprise, and even fear; and it is stated that the king
having placed himself, sword in hand, before one of
these mirrors, in order to observe the effect, was surprised
to find himself face to face with an armed hand
apparently directed against him. When he advanced,
the hand seemed to spring forward to meet him. The
king could not conceal his surprise and fright, and afterwards
felt so ashamed at being terrified with a mere
shadow that he ordered the mirror to be taken away,
and could never be prevailed upon to look into it again.”
The <i>Journal des Savants</i> then goes on quaintly to remark
on the various startling effects produced by these
mirrors, winding up by stating that its powers of reflection
were so great, that at night the light of a torch or
flambeau was reflected so perfectly that an observer
placed at four hundred feet distant could read the smallest
print.</p>

<p class='c021'>It also mentions a curious piece of superstition on
the authority of a scientific writer of the name of Robertson,
who states that it happened at Liége. In reading
the accounts of these experiments we can see how
easily the minds of individuals were affected in those
days by the wonderful. It happened while one of Villette’s
mirrors was at Liége, that the latter end of the
summer was somewhat rainy, and great fears were entertained
that a bad harvest and dear bread would be
the result. Certain evil-minded people, who had taken
a fancy to the mirror and wished to possess it by unfair
means, spread the report that the continual rain was
entirely caused by its action on the clouds and sun, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>that the coming famine must be laid upon the shoulders
of its owner and inventor. This absurd idea took such
forcible possession of the minds of the populace of
Liége, that great mobs collected together, uttering all
kinds of maledictions against the mirror and its inventor,
and at last became so violent that they attacked
Villette’s house with the intention of smashing his great
work, and administering to the unfortunate philosopher
the chastisement they supposed he deserved. Happily,
however, for M. Villette and his mirror, Liége was
governed in those days by the Prince Bishop of Cologne,
who was a man of great enlightenment. He
put the crowds round M. Villette’s to flight by armed
force, but he found that the conviction that all the coming
mischief would result from the unlucky mirror was
so strong, that he was obliged to issue a pastoral peremptorily
declaring that the idea had originated with a
number of malicious people, who spared no pains to
propagate it for their own bad purposes, and that it
was a mischievous and dangerous error to ascribe to
a mirror a power which only belonged to the Almighty.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1747, Buffon performed many extraordinary experiments
with burning mirrors, which were more surprising
than any that had hitherto been described.
They were mostly performed at the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i>,
at Paris, of which institution Buffon was director; and
many of them are worth describing.</p>

<div id='i124'  class='figcenter id021'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 25.</span>—Burning Mirror.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>On the 3rd of April, at about two o’clock in the afternoon,
the great mirror was mounted on its stand, and
was found to be capable of setting a plank of wood on
fire at a distance of 138 feet, when 128 glasses were
used, although the light was weak at the time, and the
sun was covered with mist. In pursuing these experiments
great care had to be taken to prevent the by-standers
placing themselves within range of its terrible
power, for several were nearly blinded by looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>at the brilliant focal point of the instrument. The
next day, at eleven in the forenoon, although the sun
was still covered with mist and fleecy clouds they were
able to produce such a heat at 150 feet distant, with
154 glasses, that a pitched plank began to smoulder
and would have burnt into flame had not the sun disappeared
at that particular moment. On the fifth of
April, at three in the afternoon, with the light much in
the same weak condition as it was on the other days,
they succeeded in igniting at 150 feet distant, a heap of
shavings of deal mixed with charcoal and sulphur,
in less than a minute and a half, with 154 glasses.
When, however, the sun shone with its natural power,
a few seconds were sufficient to effect these results.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the 10th, when the sun was shining pretty powerfully,
a pitched pine plank was easily fired with 128
glasses, at 150 feet distant. In this case the ignition
was very sudden, and extended over the whole of the
radiant spot forming the focus, which at the distance
named measured 16 inches in diameter. The same day
at half-past two, a pitched elm plank covered in some
places with chopped wood, was set fire to with extreme
rapidity, and burnt with such violence that it had to
be dipped in water before it could be put out. In
this experiment 148 glasses were used, at a distance of
150 feet.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the 11th of April, the burning point was fixed at
20 feet distant from the mirror, and combustible substances
were easily burnt with only 12 glasses. With
21 glasses a half-burnt elm plank was set fire to, and
with 45 a piece of tin weighing six pounds was almost
immediately melted. Silver sheet was fused, and an
iron plate was made red-hot with 117 glasses. In
giving an account of these interesting experiments,
Buffon expresses his conviction that at 50 feet it would
have been easy to have melted metals if all the glasses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of the mirrors had been used. When used at that distance,
the burning spot was six to seven inches in
diameter. He also noticed that when metals were
melted, part of them were dissipated in brilliant vapour,
which was so thick as to cast a shadow on the ground,
although it seemed to be as bright as the sun itself.
When the sun was at its full strength, and all the
glasses were brought into requisition, wood was set on
fire at a distance of over 200 feet, and metals and minerals
were fused at 40 and 50 feet. Hence the possibility
of making and using these mirrors as Archimedes
was said to have done, was proved practically by the
great naturalist. <a href='#i124'>Fig. 25</a> represents a burning mirror
in action.</p>

<p class='c021'>Robertson, an English philosopher, residing in France
during the days of the first Republic, reconstructed
the mirrors described by historians as being used by
Archimedes, and the results he obtained were thought
sufficiently important by the Council of the Department
of Ourthe to merit an attentive examination by two
members of their body, who reported in favour of their
being used as instruments of war.</p>

<p class='c021'>It would be possible to pursue this subject still further,
and give an account of numerous experiments
made on burning mirrors by various philosophers, but
we must not forget that it is light and heat that we
have more especially to deal with in the present work.
Already we have possibly strayed from our path a little
too far, but the two influences are so closely connected
with each other that it is almost impossible to speak of
them separately when reflection is in question.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> word lens is derived from the Latin name of the
seed of the <i>Ervum lens</i>, or ordinary lentil. When eating
this wholesome vegetable, almost every one has noticed
that its shape is exactly that of a double convex
lens, as represented in the following figure:—</p>

</div>
<p class='c025'>Perhaps it would be more correct if we were to say that
a double convex lens is like a lentil, rather than turn
the comparison the other way, seeing that this little
seed has given its name not only to the particular-shaped
glass depicted above, but also to some five others
more or less analogous to it.</p>
<p class='c021'>In <a href='#i128'>fig. 27</a> we have the different forms of lenses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>shown in section. The first is the <i>double convex lens</i>,
the second the <i>plano-convex</i>, the third and sixth the
<i>concavo-convex</i>, the fourth the <i>double concave</i>, and the
fifth the <i>plano-concave</i>. A <i>crossed lens</i> is a double
convex lens whose one side is more convex than the
other. The third lens is also called <i>meniscus</i>.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 27.</span>—Forms of Lenses.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The properties of the first, second, and third are
similar; that is to say, they cause parallel rays of light
passing through them to converge at a certain point,
called their focus; while the three others have a divergent
action on rays passing through them. By examining
the path of the rays through these lenses, we
shall find that the first three magnify objects seen
through them, while the latter have the contrary effect.</p>

<p class='c021'>As in the case of the curved mirrors, the rays falling
on the surface of a convex lens may be either parallel,
divergent, or convergent. In the case of parallel rays,
as depicted in the following figure, they are represented
as meeting at a point beyond the lens, which is called
the sidereal focus, or the focus for parallel rays. It is
generally found by causing the image of the sun or of
some distant object to be thrown by the lens upon a
screen, or by knowing the curvature of the faces, and
the refractive power of the glass.</p>

<p class='c021'>Every ray on striking the surface of the lens is refracted
inwards, until it meets with its companions at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the focus <span class='fss'>F</span>, in accordance with the law of refraction,
by which a ray of light passing from one transparent
medium, such as air, to another which in this instance
is glass, becomes refracted or bent in proportion to the
relative density of the two mediæ. The nearer the ray
passes to the edge of the lens, the more it is refracted,
the angle of incidence being greater; the ray through
the exact centre being uninfluenced by the form of the
glass. Hence they all meet in a single point. Figs.
29 and 30 show the path of the rays when they are
divergent and convergent.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>If the rays of light are not parallel, as in the case
of the source of light being near the lens, they do not
converge so rapidly as when they proceed from a distant
object, consequently the focus for near objects is
longer in proportion to their distance. In <a href='#i129b'>fig. 29</a> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>instance, if a candle be placed as shown, and a screen
on the other side of the lens, a point will be found
where the image of the candle is seen upon it in a reversed
position. The distance between these two
points is always relative, and they are called conjugate
foci. Thus, the candle may change places with the
screen with a similar effect, as long as the exact position
of the two points is preserved. If the candle is placed
farther off, we must diminish the distance between the
screen and the lens, and <i>vice versâ</i>. In fact, the nearer
the object, the longer the focus; the farther it is off,
the shorter the focus. Half an hour’s experiment
with a double convex lens, a piece of white cardboard,
and a small candle, will teach the student more about
the properties of convex lenses than a chapter of explanation.
A common magnifying-glass, or even an
old spectacle lens, will serve the purpose of more expensive
instruments.</p>

<p class='c021'>We now proceed to speak of the images formed
by lenses. In <a href='#i131'>fig. 31</a> we have a flower placed on one
side of a lens. As it is not at an infinite distance, the
rays sent out by its various parts are convergent, and
not parallel, consequently they do not meet at the
sidereal focus, but at a point beyond it, according to the
rule already laid down. The rays proceeding from the
exact centre of the flower striking the lens exactly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the middle at right angles, suffer no change, the others
being refracted in proportion to their angles of incidence.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 31.</span>—Images formed by Convex Lenses.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The rays proceeding from the flower cross each other
at a certain point: hence the image on the screen is
reversed. The dimensions of the image will depend on
the distance of the object from the lens. This is a fact
we meet with every day, when using an opera-glass or
a telescope. Images formed by convex lenses upon a
screen are called by opticians <i>real images</i>, in contradistinction
to those which are the result of mere reflection,
as in the case of plane mirrors. These latter are known
as <i>virtual images</i> and are produced by convex lenses
as well as by plain reflecting surfaces. In <a href='#i132'>fig. 32</a>, for
instance, the unreversed image of the insect seen by the
eye is not a real image, but a virtual one,—a fact that
might be easily proved by placing a screen in the position
of the eye, when it would be found that no image
would be formed.</p>

<p class='c021'>When using an ordinary magnifying-glass we see the
virtual image of the object we are looking at, but in the
case of a telescope or opera-glass we see the real image
of the object, formed by the large lens in front, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>reversed again by the arrangement of small lenses next
to the eye.</p>

<p class='c021'>Double concave lenses produce effects which are just
the reverse of those we have been considering. Instead
of increasing in thickness from the edges to the centre,
they follow the contrary plan, and increase from the
centre to the edges. Consequently, instead of the rays
meeting at the focus, they diverge from each other, and
gradually spread out, as shown in <a href='#i132b'>fig. 33</a>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The above figure shows the path of the rays proceeding
from the vase, and meeting the eye at such an angle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>that the virtual image is greatly diminished. Concave
lenses, as the student has no doubt already guessed, do
not give real images.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The effects produced by the action of concave mirrors
may be produced with just as much facility by convex
lenses. If a body is placed in a focus of a lens which
receives the direct rays of the sun, the heat as well as
the light will be concentrated at one point; and if the
object is combustible, it will take fire sooner or later,
according to the size of the lens. All the experiments
mentioned by Buffon as being produced by a concave
mirror are equally obtainable with a concave lens.
When of sufficient diameter, the most refractory metals,
such as platinum or iridium, may be melted and dissipated
into vapour. Before lucifer matches and vesuvians
were as common as they are now, it was not at
all unusual to find smokers carrying a small burning-glass
and a piece of tinder, for the purpose of lighting
their pipes or cigars; and there hardly exists a boy who
has not lighted a bonfire in the fields or playground by
means of an old spectacle lens or telescope glass.</p>

<p class='c021'>Amongst other applications of this property of lenses
may be mentioned that of causing guns to fire at a
certain time, by arranging a small burning-glass above
the touch-hole. In the Gardens of the Palais Royal, at
Paris, there is such a gun, so arranged that on sunny
days it fires exactly at noon, or, in other words, at the
moment the sun comes to the meridian. Every fine
day towards twelve o’clock, crowds of Parisians who
have nothing to do may be seen bending their steps
towards the Palais Royal to set their watches by the
gun, which they believe to be superior as a time-keeper
to the finest chronometer in the world. There they
stand, most of them old fellows with a scar or two about
their faces, showing that they have nobly won the rest
they appear to enjoy so innocently and calmly with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>watch in hand, leaning against the railings, and waiting
with impatience the moment when true solar noon is
indicated by the sharp report of the little piece. Their
belief in the correctness of solar time is something
astonishing; and if a bystander were to insinuate, no
matter how delicately, that solar time varied slightly
every now and then, he would either receive a smile of
pitying contempt, or else he would be called out upon
the spot. <a href='#i134'>Fig. 34</a> gives a pretty view of the celebrated
cannon of the Palais Royal.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>We now come to another application of the refracting
power of lenses, in the way of concentrating rays,
which is infinitely more valuable to humanity than
either of those we have just mentioned; we mean the
construction of enormous refracting apparatuses for
lighthouse purposes. The first lighthouse of which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>have any record is that which was erected on the island
of Pharos, by Ptolemy Philadelphus, in the year 470
of the foundation of Rome. This was merely a tower,
upon the top of which fires were kept burning at night;
but as the world progressed, the blazing tar-barrel or
wood fire gave place to the carefully-constructed lamp
and silvered reflector apparatus, which are fast disappearing
in their turn before the electric or Drummond light
and the refracting apparatus constructed by Fresnel,
who was the first to endeavour to abolish the old-fashioned
and inefficient metallic mirror from the
lanterns of lighthouses. <a href='#i136'>Fig. 35</a> shows a section of
Fresnel’s apparatus. <span class='fss'>A</span> is a plano-convex lens of about
a foot in diameter, whose focus corresponds with those
of the concentric lenticular rings of glass which surround
it, and which are seen more plainly in <a href='#i140'>fig. 36</a>.
These rings, which are ground and polished with the
greatest accuracy, are somewhat in the shape of an
ordinary quoit, and are equivalent to a plano-convex
lens with the centre portion cut out. This arrangement
is so powerful that the distance at which a light provided
with it can be seen is only limited by bad weather,
the state of the atmosphere and the distance of the
horizon. It is common for such lights to be seen at a
distance of between fifty and sixty miles. The apparatus
is mostly arranged in the form of an octagon,
and is generally provided with additional reflecting
mirrors at those parts above the light which are out of
the range of the lenses. The light shining fully in eight
directions at one time, can scarcely be missed by any
ship within range; but in order to guard against any
possibility of accident, the optical apparatus is often
made to revolve by clockwork, so that every point of
the ocean is illuminated in turn. By using coloured
glasses, or by causing the light to disappear at distinct
intervals, different lighthouses may be identified by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>ships that are out of their reckoning. <a href='#i140'>Fig. 36</a> represents
the interior of the lantern of a first-class lighthouse,
showing the arrangement of the lenticular rings
round the central lens. If ever the student should
pass through Havre, he should not miss the opportunity
of seeing this noble apparatus, which is one of
the finest ever manufactured.</p>

  <h2 id='ch2-08' class='c012'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><span class='c020'> OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS.—THE SIMPLE AND COMPOUND MICROSCOPE. THE SOLAR AND PHOTO-ELECTRIC MICROSCOPE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> lenses and mirrors whose properties we have
been considering in the previous chapters, have been
combined in different ways for the purpose of examining
objects too small or too distant to be perceived by
the human eye. To instruments used for the former
purpose the name of microscope has been given, from
two Greek words signifying <i>small</i> and <i>to see</i>. In like
manner the name of telescope is also derived from two
Greek words, meaning <i>distant</i> and <i>to see</i>. Besides
these two classes of optical instruments, others have
been devised to facilitate the depicting of natural
objects, either by means of the pencil or of photography,
or to amuse the eye by optical illusions. Thus
we have the camera obscura, the camera lucida, the
magic lantern, the phantasmagoria, and numberless
other instruments of the same sort, most of which will
be described in the latter part of this book.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are two sorts of microscopes, the simple and
the compound; the one consisting of a single convex
lens, and the other of several combinations of both
convex and concave lenses.</p>

<p class='c021'>When speaking of convex lenses, we described the
properties of the ordinary magnifying-glass, or simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>microscope. The uses of this instrument are almost too
well known to need description. It is used by old
people, the lenses of whose eyes have become flattened
by old age, by watchmakers for examining the minute
portions of their work, by jewellers for the same purpose,
and by most people for examining maps, engravings,
and photographs. Simple microscopes are
generally mounted in horn, ivory, or metal handles for
convenience’ sake. Some simple microscopes consist
of two or more lenses mounted together in order to increase
the magnifying power. The student must distinguish
between several lenses mounted together in
this way, and the true compound microscope, which is a
comparatively complicated optical arrangement, as we
shall see presently. When two single lenses are thus
mounted together, the power of the combination is equal
to the powers of each added together.</p>

<p class='c021'>There is good reason for supposing that the simple
microscope is a comparatively ancient invention. Seneca,
who lived in the first century, declares that in his
time it was well known that, when writing was looked
at through a globe full of water, it appeared larger and
blacker. In the eighth century we find the use of magnifying
spectacles for old people common in most countries,
and yet it was only at the beginning of the seventeenth
century that a true optical instrument, in the
form of a telescope, was invented. It only needed the
placing of two magnifying glasses in a line to discover
the principle of the telescope, but nearly a thousand
years elapsed after the first introduction of these glasses
before an accident rendered the principle evident.</p>

<p class='c021'>In <a href='#i143'>fig. 37</a> we see the commonest form of microscope
in the hands of an observer; and by examining the
following figure and tracing out the path of the rays,
we shall easily discover the principles on which its
action depends.</p>

<div id='i143'  class='figcenter id021'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 37.</span>—The Compound Microscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The object to be looked at is placed at <i>a</i> (<a href='#i144'>fig. 38</a>), on
a piece of thin glass usually called a <i>slide</i>. A small
converging lens placed at <i>b</i> collects the rays proceeding
from the object, and transmits them as far as <i>c d</i>, where
they come under the influence of a second converging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>lens <span class='fss'>B</span>, which causes them to spread out still more before
they reach the eye. Consequently we not only
see the image of the object magnified
by the lens <i>b</i>, but still more enlarged
by the action of the lens <span class='fss'>B</span>,
and appearing considerably enlarged
at <span class='fss'>C D</span>. The lens placed in front of
the object is called the <i>objective</i> or
<i>object-glass</i>; that placed nearest the
eye, the <i>eye-piece</i>. These names
apply equally to the similar lenses
used in telescopes and other optical
instruments. The instrument shown
in <a href='#i144'>fig. 38</a> is the simplest possible
compound microscope, and is very
rarely used. The eye-piece is generally
constructed of two lenses, and
the object-glass of as many as eight;
the object in multiplying the lenses
being, not only to increase the magnifying
power, but to decrease certain
defects inherent in all lenses
whose surfaces are parts of spheres.</p>

<div id='i144'  class='figleft id024'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 38.</span>—The Theory of the Compound Microscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The amplification depends mainly
upon the power of the objective,
but different eye-pieces are also used
to increase the apparent size of the
objects to be examined. Thanks to
the investigations of modern philosophers, we are enabled
to magnify objects to 2,000 times their diameter
with perfect distinctness; that is to say, the surface of
the object appears to occupy 4,000,000 times its natural
extent. Under such a power a hair would appear
about six inches thick, a fine needle would look like a
street post, and a grain of sand like a mass of rock.
Although it is possible to employ compound microscopes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of such a high magnifying power in the investigation
of certain classes of objects, all ordinary preparations
are best seen under a power of 500 or 600 diameters.
It would be utterly impossible to give our readers the
slightest idea of the benefits conferred on the human
race by this marvellous instrument. Suffice it to say,
that no naturalist or surgeon ever attempts the most
simple investigation into the structure of any body
without the aid of the microscope. It has already
shown us that a world of creatures exists which, although
invisible to the eye of man, are possessed of wonderful
forms, colour, and beauty of structure, and is daily
adding to our knowledge in this direction. We can
hardly submit any substances to this marvellous instrument
without discovering animal or vegetable life of the
most vivid character. A drop of scum from the surface
of a stagnant pool is instantly seen to be peopled with
animal and vegetable life, when submitted to microscopic
examination. At one moment a rolling ball glistening
like glass slowly revolves past our view; then a little
fellow like a piece of spiral spring screws his way along,
backing when he meets with an obstacle; or a shuttle-shaped
vegetable, apparently made of glass, with green
balls inside him, slowly works his way from side to side,
or, possibly, a mad battledore-shaped being dashes past
at an inconceivable rate.</p>

<p class='c021'>As it is indispensable that the object should be well
lighted, a concave mirror is placed below it to reflect
the rays of light from a lamp or white cloud, through the
object when it is transparent. When it is opaque, it is
illuminated by the rays of light being concentrated
upon it by means of a convex lens. The name microscope
appears by common consent to be applied more particularly
to the compound instrument, the epithet of
magnifier or magnifying-glass being kept for simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>microscopes, although they are all, strictly speaking,
<i>microscopes</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the ordinary compound microscope, it is only
possible for one person to see the object to be examined
at once; for popular exhibitions of microscopic objects
the reflecting microscope has been devised, by means of
which the images of the objects to be looked at are
thrown upon a screen. The principle of this instrument
is the same as that of the magic lantern and phantasmagoria,
of which we shall speak presently. <a href='#i147'>Fig. 39</a>
(see next page) represents the photo-electric microscope,
so called from the objects being reflected by the electric
light.</p>

<p class='c021'>The jars seen on the ground are the cells of a voltaic
battery, by which the electricity is generated. The
luminous rays starting from the incandescent charcoal
points are reflected through the tube and its lenses by
the reflector placed at the back of the instrument, and
are concentrated upon the object to be magnified. The
image thus produced passes through a second system of
converging lenses, and is projected upon the screen
magnified some millions of times according to the power
of the object-glass employed.</p>

<img src='images/i147.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 39.</span>—Photo-Electric Microscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“The experiments made with the photo-electric microscopes,”
says M. Ganot, “are amongst the most curious
and pleasing to be found in the whole range of physical
science. With this instrument it is possible to show the
smallest objects magnified almost indefinitely to an unlimited
number of spectators. A human hair will appear
as large as a broomstick, an ordinary flea will look the
size of a sheep, and the tiny cheese mite, as well as the
smallest animalcules, will be visible in all their beauty of
form and colour as clearly as if they were seen with the
naked eye. One of the most remarkable experiments to
be made with this instrument is that which shows the
circulation of the blood. The tail of a live tadpole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>is inserted between two plates of glass, or on an instrument
specially made for the purpose, and placed in the
microscope armed with a somewhat low power. The
spectator immediately perceives upon the screen a mass
of rivers and rivulets, all flowing with the red corpuscles
forming the blood of the animal, and rushing through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>its veins and arteries with inconceivable rapidity.
Another interesting experiment consists in dissolving a
small quantity of sal-ammoniac in warm water, and
passing a small portion of the solution across a warm
glass slide. When placed in the microscope the water
gradually evaporates, leaving behind a mass of feathery
crystals, whose growth may be watched atom by atom,
each crystalline molecule grouping itself around the
others in forms resembling a mass of fern-leaves.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The apparatus we have been describing is sometimes
illuminated with the rays of the sun, as in the following
figure.</p>

<div id='i148'  class='figcenter id021'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 40.</span>—Solar Microscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It is then called the solar microscope, and exhibits
objects with great beauty and clearness. The use of the
sun’s rays, however, has, in our own country at least,
been entirely superseded by the electric and lime light.
The latter method of illumination, which consists in
projecting a stream of oxygen and hydrogen upon a
ball of lime, is cheaper and more certain than the electric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>light, although the latter is possibly the more brilliant
of the two. The construction of the solar microscope
differs but little from the instrument already
described, and may be readily understood from the
foregoing figure. The large mirror is placed outside
the window of the room in which the microscope stands,
so that the solar rays are reflected upon the surface of
a series of convergent lenses, and from thence on to
another mirror, from which it is again reflected through
the microscope. As the position of the sun is constantly
changing, it is necessary to connect the outside mirror
with a train of clockwork. It may be mentioned that
an instrument of this kind, for reflecting the sun’s rays,
is called a heliostat.</p>

<p class='c021'>The student will, no doubt, at once perceive that if
we concentrate the light of the sun upon an object, we
shall also concentrate the heat, and either melt or consume
it. A screen is therefore used in such cases,
which will allow the light to pass while holding back
the rays of heat. A solution of alum is found to answer
the purpose admirably.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>If</span> history has failed to furnish us with the name of
the inventor of the microscope, we have very exact information
as to the first experimenters upon the powers
of the telescope.</p>

<p class='c021'>“In the archives of the Hague,” says Arago, “we
find documents, by the aid of which Van Swieten and
Moll have come to a decisive conclusion as to the first
and true inventor of the telescope.”</p>

<p class='c021'>We read in these documents that a spectacle-maker
of Middleburg, named John Lippershey, addressed a
petition to the States-General on October 2, 1606, in
which he asked leave to take out a patent, which should
constitute him the only maker of this instrument, or
which should confer upon him an annual pension, on
the condition of not manufacturing them for other nations.
The petition qualifies the instrument as serving
to see distinct objects, as had already been explained
to the members of the States-General.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the 4th of October, 1608, the States-General
appointed a deputy from each province to experiment
on the new instrument, which was placed on a tower of
the palace belonging to the Stadtholder. Huggard
says that the first telescopes experimented on were a
foot and a half in length.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>On the 6th of October, the commission declared the
instrument of Lippershey to be useful to the nation, but
demanded that it should be made for two eyes instead
of one.</p>

<p class='c021'>On the 9th of December, Lippershey, having announced
that he had solved the problem, Van Dorth,
Magnus, and Van der Au were ordered to verify the
fact, which they did by making a very favourable report
on the 11th of the same month. The binocular
instrument was therefore found to answer.</p>

<p class='c021'>In reading the extracts from the archives of the
Hague, given by Moll, we may remark with great pleasure
the promptitude with which the commissioners of
the States-General examined Lippershey’s instruments.
But their satisfaction soon gave way to displeasure,
when they found a large number of opticians making
these instruments, and selling them to foreigners, like
so much spice from the East Indies. Later on one feels
indignant at finding the commissioners of the States-General
to be so wanting in proper feeling as to decide
that the telescope must be considered imperfect until it
could be used with both eyes, without either winking or
seeing the reflection of the pupils in the eye-pieces.
Consequently, instead of being permitted to expend his
talent on perfecting the optical powers of the single
telescope, Lippershey saw himself condemned to waste
his time upon the double instrument. The States-General
finished by giving Lippershey 900 florins; but
they refused him a patent, on the ground that it was
already notorious that other opticians had commenced
the manufacture of similar instruments.</p>

<p class='c021'>Amongst others who were rivals of Lippershey, we
must mention John Adrian Metius, the son of Adrian
Metius, of Amsterdam, who discovered that the nearest
relation of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
was 355 to 113. He addressed a letter to the States-General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>on the 17th of October, 1608, conceived in the
following terms:—</p>

<p class='c026'>“After two years’ labour and thought I have succeeded
in making an instrument, by the aid of which objects
which are too distant to be visible by the eye, are seen
plainly. The one I show, although constructed out of
bad materials, and simply as an experiment, is, in the
judgment of the Stadtholder and of several other persons,
as good as the one lately presented to the States-General
by a citizen of Middleburg. I am sure of improving
it still further in the course of time, and I beg
to ask for a patent by which any person who is not
already in possession of this invention will be forbidden,
under pain of a heavy fine and confiscation, to make or
sell similar instruments for twenty-two years.”</p>

<p class='c024'>The States-General refused to grant the patent in
this case also, but enjoined Metius to perfect his instrument,
reserving to themselves the power to reward him
in the future if they thought fit.</p>

<p class='c021'>In Italy, Galileo is generally supposed to have discovered
independently the method of making a telescope
on the principle of the Dutch philosophers, about the
beginning of 1609, having received a very imperfect
account of these instruments somewhere about that
time. It may be remarked that in his letter to the
chiefs of the Venetian Republic, giving an account of
the properties of these new instruments, Galileo states
that, if necessary, they could be made specially for the
use of the navy and army belonging to the state. But
secrecy was useless, for telescopes were already made
and sold in Holland at a cheap rate. Besides, Galileo
makes no allusion to the labours of his Dutch predecessors,
either in a prior letter handed down to us by
Venturi, or in the decree of the Venetian Senate, dated
August 5, 1609.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Italian commentators are in error when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>attribute the second discovery of the telescope to the
knowledge that Galileo possessed of the laws of refraction,
and that it was by deductions therefrom that he
was enabled to construct his first instruments.</p>

<p class='c021'>Huyghens says, in his <i>Treatise on Dioptrics</i>, “I will
unhesitatingly place that man above all mortals, who,
by the aid of his own reflections and without the aid of
accident, first succeeded in constructing a telescope.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Let us see,” says Arago, when speaking on this
subject, “if Lippershey and John Adrian Metius were
men of unparalleled powers.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Hieronymus Saturnus tells us that an unknown man
of genius called upon Lippershey, and ordered from him
a number of convex and concave lenses. At the time
agreed upon the man returned, and chose two, one convex
and the other concave, and, placing them one before
his eye and the other at some distance from it, drew
them backwards and forwards, without giving any explanation
of his manœuvres, paid the optician, and left
the place. As soon as he was gone, Lippershey began
immediately to imitate the experiments of the stranger,
and soon found that distant objects were brought apparently
nearer, when the lenses were placed in certain
positions. He next fastened them to the ends of a tube,
and lost no time in presenting the new instrument to
Prince Maurice of Nassau.</p>

<p class='c021'>According to another version, Lippershey’s children
were playing in their father’s shop, and were looking
through two lenses, one convex and the other concave,
when they found to their surprise that the vane on the
clock-tower of Middleburg Church was greatly magnified
and apparently brought nearer. The surprise expressed
by the children having awakened the attention
of Lippershey, he tried the experiment of fixing the
lenses on a piece of board; afterwards he tried it again
by fixing them at the ends of two pieces of tube, sliding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>in each other, and succeeded in making the first telescope
on record.</p>

<p class='c021'>The principal documents from which the above facts
touching Lippershey have been extracted, are to be
found in a memoir on the subject by Olbers, printed in
Schumacher’s <i>Astronomical Annual</i> for 1843.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was said in the time of Galileo that he had in his
possession a telescope by the aid of which he could see
the birds flying at Fiesole from the window of his palace
in Florence. This story does not in the least detract
from the merit of the illustrious astronomer, who not
only constructed a telescope for himself, but was the
first to direct it heavenwards, and that too by purely
theoretical researches; for in spite of all the documents
adduced above, there is little or no proof that he had
ever seen or heard of the Dutchman’s telescope. It is
only right, therefore, that the instrument constructed
on this principle should be called the Galilean telescope.
He afterwards increased its power from four to
thirty times, beyond which he could not get with the
means at his command. With his imperfect instruments
Galileo discovered the satellites of Jupiter, the mountains
of the moon, and the spots on the sun, and earned
for himself the name of Lynceus, who according to the
ancients was one of the Argonauts, possessed of the
power of seeing through a wall. Towards the end of
his life, when the old man was blind, and the Academy
of the Lincei treated his hypotheses with disdain, he
would laugh sadly at the name bestowed on him, and
the obstinate Academy. <a href='#i155'>Fig. 41</a> (see next page)
shows the path of the rays in a Galilean telescope. The
object-glass <i>O</i> is double convex, and the eye-piece o bi-concave.
The image is formed between these lenses,
and the eye appears to see it at that point. The States-General
complained of being obliged to shut one eye
when looking through a telescope, but in 1671 a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Capuchin monk, whose name was Cherubino, placed two
telescopes together, little thinking that the moderns
would imitate him in that very worldly instrument, the
opera-glass.</p>

<p class='c021'>Everybody has noticed that when objects are close to
us they appear larger than when they are at a distance;
it accordingly amounts to the same thing whether, in
speaking of the power of telescopes, we say they magnify
twice, four times, or a hundred times, or that they
are brought within half, a quarter, or a hundredth of
their distance. Thus there is a telescope at Lord Rosse’s
Observatory, at Parsonstown in Ireland, which is the
finest yet constructed. Its highest magnifying power
is 6,000, therefore every object we look at with it is
brought within the 6,000th of its distance from us.
Looking at the moon, for instance, we know that our
satellite is distant some 240,000 miles from us; we
have, therefore, only to divide that number by 6,000 to
find that by means of this wonderful instrument the
moon is brought within 40 miles of the earth. This
statement, however, is not strictly true, for it supposes
the whole of the apparatus used to be theoretically perfect.</p>

<p class='c021'>Kepler, whose great name is now-a-days always associated
with that of Galileo, but who during their life-time
was somewhat his rival, substituted for the single
lens forming the eye-piece a combination consisting of
two convex lenses, in order to obtain a larger field for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>observation than that given by the single bi-concave.
This combination is commonly known as the astronomical
eye-piece. It reverses the object looked at, but
for astronomical purposes this defect is of no consequence.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>The instrument shown in the above figure represents
an astronomical telescope reduced to its simplest
form.</p>

<p class='c021'>Fixed parallel to the axis of the larger telescope is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the finder, a small telescope of low power and large
field, used for finding celestial objects not easily visible
to the naked eye. It is so arranged, that when the
object is found and carried to its centre, it is also in the
centre of the field of the larger instrument. The handle
and the two toothed wheels serve to raise or lower the
telescope, which is movable on the horizontal axis,
which supports it in front, so that it may be directed to
any part of the heavens the observer may desire.</p>

<p class='c021'>The following figure shows the arrangement of the
lenses, and the path of the rays through them, in telescopes
of this form.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The convex lens which serves as an object-glass, gives
at <i>a b</i> a reversed image of the star <span class='fss'>A B</span>. The small convex
lens which acts the part of an eye-piece, enlarged
this reversed image without changing its position, and
causes it to be seen in the line <span class='fss'>A´ B´</span>. This eye-piece is
fixed at the extremity of a tube, which is smaller than
that containing the object-glass, and slides easily backwards
and forwards from the spot where the image <i>a b</i>
is found. The latter is an indispensable condition, for
it is rare to meet two persons whose eyes are of the
same focus; besides, the image <i>a b</i> will fall at a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>spot for objects at different distances: thus, if you are
looking at the moon, and suddenly turn the instrument
on to a distant nebula, you will find that the eye-piece
requires adjusting. In showing ordinary observers an
object in the telescope, it is well to insist on their moving
the eye-piece backwards and forwards until distinct
vision is obtained, for it often happens that people will
say they see an object quite distinctly, when it is in
reality misty, and will generally refuse to allow the
focus to be altered. It is very singular how human
vanity or complaisance will step in when some persons
are looking through a telescope. They seem to think
that there is some disgrace or rudeness involved in their
not being able to see what their predecessors at the
instrument have seen. Poor John Leech leaves us an
amusing instance of this in a comic cut inserted in
one of the early numbers of our old friend <i>Punch</i>. A
gentleman is endeavouring to show a lady a distant
steamboat through a telescope, but she has it accidentally
pointed at two swans that are swimming on
the margin of the lake below; consequently when he
asks her if she sees the steamer, she replies that
“she sees it most distinctly, and there are two of
them,” a pretty good proof that the instrument was
not only pointed at the wrong object, but was out of
focus as well.</p>

<p class='c021'>In constructing a telescope similar to the one described
above, the object-glass ought to be of considerable
diameter and of long focus; the eye-piece, on the
contrary, should be comparatively small and of short
focus. A little consideration will show the reason of
this. An object-glass of long focus will form a large
image at the point <i>a b</i>, and the eye-piece of short focus
will magnify this image more than another lens of less
convexity. It is, however, on the size, length of focus,
and perfection of workmanship of the objective that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>excellence of the telescope depends; large object-glasses
are consequently rare, and are only to be found in observatories
of the first class. The object-glass of the
large telescope at the Observatory at Paris is nearly
fifteen inches in diameter, and the highest magnifying
power capable of being employed with it is 3,000. The
Observatory of Pulkowa, near St. Petersburg, possesses
a similar instrument, and the Observatory at Chicago,
United States, a still larger one, measuring between
eighteen and nineteen inches in diameter. But the
largest of all is an objective in the possession of Mr.
Buckingham, an amateur astronomer, who has an observatory
near London, which is twenty inches in diameter,
and twenty-eight feet in focal length.</p>

<p class='c021'>The eye-pieces of astronomical telescopes are of different
powers, and are changed according to the class
of object to be observed. Thus, in taking a general
view of the moon, a low power would be used. If you
wished to examine any particular mountain, you would
raise the magnifying power by inserting a stronger eye-piece.
The power used also depends on the state of the
atmosphere. For instance, on warm evenings, when the
air is charged with moisture, the tremulousness of the
atmosphere is so great, that it is often only possible to
use the very lowest power. By combining four convex
lenses together, we obtain what is called a terrestrial or
erecting eye-piece, which has the property of <i>re-reversing</i>
the image formed by the objective. The eye-pieces of
all telescopes for use on land or at sea are made on this
principle. The same effect may be obtained, as we have
already shown in <a href='#i155'>fig. 41</a>, by using a concave lens, but
in this the field of view is much diminished.</p>

<p class='c021'>Hitherto we have only spoken of refracting telescopes
or those instruments provided with a convex object-glass,
to collect and refract the rays of light given off
by the object we are desirous of examining; but there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>another and very important class of instruments, in
which the object-glass is replaced by a reflecting mirror.
The first reflecting telescope was invented by Dr. Gregory,
an English philosopher, about 1650. It consisted
of a brass tube, at the lower extremity of which
was fixed a concave mirror made of metal, and provided
with a hole in its centre for the insertion of the small
tube containing the eye-glass. Towards the other
end of the telescope was placed a second and smaller
mirror, which reflected the image formed by the large
mirror, through the eye-piece to the eye. The following
figure will show the path of the rays in the Gregorian
telescope.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 44.</span>—Section of the Gregorian Telescope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The rays <span class='fss'>A B</span>, proceeding from the object at which
the instrument is pointed, are first reflected from the
surface of the principal mirror <span class='fss'>M M</span> on to the small
mirror <i>m</i>, whence they proceed to form a magnified
image at <i>a b</i>, which is then again enlarged by the eye-piece
appearing to the eye as if placed at <span class='fss'>A´ B´</span>. The
focus in the Gregorian is altered, not by sliding the
eye-piece backwards and forwards but by moving the
mirror <i>m</i>, which is provided with a long screw, to which
is attached a handle. At first sight a reflecting telescope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>has the appearance of a very stumpy-looking refracting
instrument, but one instant’s examination will
show the observer that the usual object-glass is absent
at the end of the tube. In <a href='#i161'>fig. 45</a> we have a Gregorian
telescope, mounted on a tripod stand.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Whilst experimenting on the Gregorian telescope,
Newton made certain improvements in its construction,
which we shall proceed to describe. A glance at <a href='#i162'>fig. 46</a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>will show that the path of the rays is much more
simple than in the instrument we have just noticed.</p>

<p class='c021'>The rays of light <span class='fss'>A B</span> are first reflected from the
concave mirror <span class='fss'>M</span> on to the surface of the small plane
mirror <i>m</i>, which is placed at an angle of 45°, and reflects
them as far as the point <span class='fss'>A´ B´</span>, where they form
the image to be magnified by the eye-glass. It is
therefore at the <i>side</i> of the instrument, and not at the
end, as hitherto, that the observer is placed, and at
right angles to the path of the rays. Observers looking
at an object through a Newtonian telescope for the
first time are generally sufficiently astonished to find
that there is really no difficulty after all in seeing round
a corner. We shall presently return to the subject of
Newtonian telescopes, which were abandoned by astronomers
for many years, until they were brought into
use again by M. Foucault, a distinguished French philosopher.</p>

<p class='c021'>Towards the end of the last century Sir William
Herschel invented and constructed the reflecting telescope
which bears his name. His great object was to
avoid the loss of light consequent on the double reflection
which took place in all instruments constructed up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to that time, and he succeeded at last in making a telescope
in which the observer looked directly through the
eye-piece at the image formed by the mirror, which was
inclined in such a manner that the rays were reflected
to the lower edge of the open end of the tube. In
using this kind of telescope the observer is placed with
his back to the object he wishes to examine, a position
that is even more astonishing to those unaccustomed to
the use of a Herschellian telescope than the one assumed
when employing an instrument of the Newtonian construction.
This position has the defect of causing a
small portion of the rays proceeding from the object to
be intercepted by the head of the observer, but the
amount of light lost is so small in comparison to the
size of the mirror that in practice it amounts to nothing.</p>

<p class='c021'>The dimensions of the telescope constructed by Herschel
were enormous for that day. It measured 40 feet
long, and the mirror was 4 feet in diameter. It was
supported by a complicated system of scaffolding, pulleys,
and cords, and was capable of magnifying an object
6,000 times. It was by means of this splendid instrument
that Sir William Herschel made those wonderful
discoveries in astronomy which are inseparably associated
with his name. With it he discovered the planet
Uranus, many of the double stars, and a large number
of nebulæ, which up to that time were unknown. His
son, Sir John Herschel, inherits his father’s talents as
an astronomer, and has enriched science with numberless
observations and discoveries of the greatest importance
made with this fine instrument. <a href='#i164'>Fig. 47</a> shows
the construction of the Herschellian telescope, and the
path of the rays may be easily followed by the student
without any help from us.</p>

<p class='c021'>The vulgar, ever prone to make mountains out of
molehills, magnified the power of Sir William Herschel’s
telescope beyond all bounds. Stories were circulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>about his having given a dinner in the interior of the
tube to a select party of friends, but as the diameter
of the telescope was only a little more than 4 feet, the
entertainment, to say the least of it, would have proved
somewhat inconvenient to the guests. Another story,
which was credited by great numbers of people, was
that he had discovered inhabitants in the moon, but that
he hesitated to make the matter public for fear he should
be prosecuted for spreading atheistical notions. In fact,
the tales told of Sir William Herschel’s telescope were
endless, and caused the astronomer great inconvenience
by attracting crowds of idle people to the neighbourhood
of Slough, where he vainly endeavoured to carry
on his investigations in peace and quietness. It was in
vain that these silly assertions were disproved again
and again. Having once believed them, people were
slow to reject them, and the story of the dinner was
told over and over again for many years.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 47.</span>—The Herschellian Telescope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The instrument above described is one of those known
as <i>front view telescopes</i>, on account of the image of the
star being reflected from the surface of the mirror,
which was placed obliquely at the bottom of the tube
in front of the observer, who examined it by means of
the eye-piece without any other reflection taking place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>thereby effecting a saving of light, which fully compensated
for any loss caused by the mirror being placed
askew. The concave mirror made by Herschel alone
weighed a ton, to say nothing of the enormous tube and
its fittings. Herschel had consequently to invent a
special apparatus for holding and moving this gigantic
instrument. The moving gear consisted of a mass of
beams, pulleys and cords, reminding one more of the
rigging of a ship than of a philosophical instrument.
The apparatus for moving the telescope appeared so
complicated to the casual observer, although in reality
it was very simple, that it doubtless contributed in no
small degree to the propagation of the fanciful stories
we have already spoken of.</p>

<p class='c021'>The performances of this splendid instrument hardly
came up to the expectations of those who saw it in progress.
Herschel, it is true, was enabled by its means
to use a power of from 3 to 6,000, but he could only
use these amplifications on a few objects—the planets,
for instance, giving so little light under a high power
as to become indistinct and misty. In 1802 Baron von
Zach, in his <i>Monthly Astronomical Compendium</i>, went
so far as to say that this colossal instrument was not of
the slightest utility, that no discovery had ever been
made with it, and that it ought to be considered merely
as an optical curiosity. Subsequent events, however,
proved very conclusively that Baron von Zach was utterly
wrong in his statements and prophecies.</p>

<p class='c021'>The telescope constructed by Herschel, although
very wonderful for the day in which it was made, has
long since been eclipsed by that belonging to Lord Rosse,
and erected by his late father at Birr Castle, near
Parsonstown in Ireland. It is superior to Herschel’s
instrument both in point of size, and workmanship.
The late Lord Rosse, not fearing that his dignity
would be compromised by such an act, went boldly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>work, and learned to polish mirrors like an ordinary
workman, the consequence of which was that he could
bestow unusual pains upon the finishing of the speculum.
His Lordship not only learnt the mere handicraft of
speculum polishing, but went deeply into the engineering
difficulties of the operation, and succeeded in inventing
many improvements for diminishing labour and rendering
the form of the surface more perfect. The
specula ground and polished under Lord Rosse’s method
are almost entirely free from what is called spherical
aberration,—that is to say, all rays proceeding from
a single point of light, such as a star, are collected into
a single point instead of being scattered in a round
mass. This freedom from spherical aberration is of
course necessary to produce perfectly distinct images.
In his <i>Life of Newton</i> Sir David Brewster calls it one
of the most marvellous combinations of art and science
yet seen in the world.</p>

<p class='c021'>The tube of Lord Rosse’s instrument is 55 feet long,
and weighs 6½ tons. In form it may be compared to
the chimney of a steamboat of enormous size. At one
end it terminates in a kind of square box, within which
is contained the mirror, whose diameter is 6 feet, and
which weighs nearly 4 tons. The weight of the whole
apparatus is consequently nearly 10½ tons, or four
times as much as Herschel’s. It is erected on an
oblong mass of masonry, 75 feet in length from north
to south, between two solid walls nearly 50 feet high,
which serve as supports for the mechanism intended to
move this enormous tube in all directions. To the
walls are also fixed movable staircases with platforms
that can be brought up to the eye-piece with the greatest
facility, no matter in what position the telescope
may be placed. This noble instrument has penetrated
space to a distance perfectly unattempted before its existence,
and has resolved numerous nebulæ into masses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of stars that until then were supposed to be mere
clouds of luminous matter. The exact forms of other
nebulæ have also been accurately determined by this
telescope, which fully deserves the glowing eulogium
passed upon it by the Duke of Argyle in his presidential
address at the meeting of the British Association
at Glasgow, in 1855. “This instrument,” said his
Grace, “in extending the range of astronomical science
as it has done, has been the means of throwing certain
doubts upon the laws that govern the motions of the
heavenly bodies, and render it possible that certain of
the far-distant nebulæ are regulated in their movements
by other laws than those to which the members of our
own system are subjected.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The clearness with which this telescope exhibits every
object within its range is so great that the most distant
nebulæ are seen with as great distinctness as the nearest
planet. On directing it towards the moon, which is
only distant from us about 240,000 miles, the surface
of our satellite may be explored with a facility almost
as great as that with which we examine the details of a
landscape with an ordinary telescope.</p>

<p class='c021'>Maedler, a German astronomer, who has measured
nearly every mountain and valley on the moon’s surface
with the greatest exactitude, stated some years before
Lord Rosse’s telescope was perfected that if a monument
as large as one of the Pyramids existed on the
surface of the moon it could have been readily distinguished
by the instruments then in use. With Lord
Rosse’s telescope we can see the surface of our satellite
so much enlarged that a space 220 feet square could be
readily perceived by a good observer. This enormous
eye, measuring 6 feet in diameter, would hardly show
us a lunar elephant; but it is certain that if a troop of
buffaloes, or animals analogous to them, crossed the
field of vision, they would undoubtedly be perceptible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Masses of troops marching backwards and forwards
would also be plainly visible, and we may assert with
something like absolute certainty that there are neither
towns nor villages in the moon, nor any buildings as
large as St. Paul’s of London or the colossal railway
stations of that metropolis.</p>

<p class='c021'>This telescope, as we have said before, is the largest
hitherto constructed, and cost its noble constructor
more than 25,000<i>l.</i> It must also be recollected that it
was not a mere scientific toy belonging to an amateur
philosopher, but a real working instrument in the
possession of a true man of science, who did work with
it that will render his name famous while civilization
lasts. The present Lord Rosse seems worthy in every
way of his father’s great name, and has already enriched
astronomical science with numerous valuable
observations.</p>

<p class='c021'>We shall finish this chapter by a description of the
Newtonian telescope constructed by M. Léon Foucault.
The mirror, instead of being made of speculum metal,
which is an alloy of tin and copper, is made of glass
from the famous manufactory of St. Gobain. The first
rough grinding having been finished, it passed into the
workshops of M. Secrétan, the optician to the Paris
Observatory, to receive its final polish and finishing
touches from the hand of M. Foucault himself, the most
careful optical tests being applied to it before the commencement
of each operation.</p>

<p class='c021'>The glass mirror having reached the degree of perfection
desired, was then silvered on its concave surface
by being plunged into a bath of nitrate of silver,
dissolved in water, and mixed with certain proportions
of gum galbanum, nitrate of ammonia, and oil of cloves.
Half an hour in this bath was sufficient for the deposition
of a film of silver of sufficient thickness to bear
polishing. When finished, the mirror was found to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>reflect 92 per cent. of the light incident on its surface,
the loss in the case of achromatic object-glasses and
metal specula being 20 and 35 per cent. respectively.
The substitution of a parabolic glass mirror for the
ordinary metal speculum offers the triple advantage of
greater lightness, increased distinctness, and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>brilliant images. <a href='#i169'>Fig. 48</a> represents the large silvered
glass telescope constructed under M. Foucault’s
direction for the observatory at Marseilles. It measures
32 inches in diameter, and has a focal length of a little
more than 16 feet, and is put in motion by clockwork of
a very perfect description, so that when once pointed at
a star or planet it follows the object, which would otherwise
disappear on account of the rotation of the earth.
The path taken by the rays is precisely the same as in
Newton’s telescope, the eye-piece being placed at the side
of the tube, which is provided with a movable platform
and staircase for the observer.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>The optician to whose talent in his art this fine instrument
is due, has recently executed several small
telescopes upon the same model, at such a price as to
bring them within the reach of amateurs with slender
purses. The principal part of these telescopes, one of
which is represented in <a href='#i171'>fig. 49</a>, (see next page), is the
mirror, which is about 4 inches in diameter, and 24
inches’ focal length. The body, which is cylindrical, is
made of brass, and revolves on two pivots placed horizontally
at about one-third of its length from the bottom.
The bearings on which the pivots move consist of two
upright standards of metal, which are connected at the
bottom, and revolve on a pin in the middle of the plate
of the tripod stand. They are made of such a height
that the lower portion of the instrument may pass between
them, when it is necessary to observe objects in
the zenith. By the turn of a screw the whole of the
upper portion of the instrument may be dismounted and
fixed on a lower standard, so that the observer may work
sitting down if necessary. The body of the telescope
is provided with a finder. One of the great advantages
of this form of instrument is that it can be used for
observations on the zenith without giving the observer
those unpleasant cricks in the neck so inseparable from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the use of ordinary telescopes in a nearly upright condition.
The mirror will bear a power of 220 diameters,

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> illusions of which we have spoken in the first
part of this work depended principally on the nature of
man’s vision, who, we found, was the constant and heedless
victim of his own powers of sight. We shall now
examine a series of illusions that are still more extraordinary,
but which have nothing to do with the deceptions
practised on us by our visual organs. Instead of
being deceived by ourselves, we shall find that we are
led astray by others whose knowledge of the laws of
optics is greater than our own, enabling them to construct
instruments capable of amusing us or imposing
on us, according to our ignorance of natural laws. Let
us hope, however, that the science of optics has now
become so familiar to most educated people, that no such
thing as a real imposition can take place, although at
the present day there are so many exhibitions of the
marvellous that ordinary observers have the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>difficulty in accounting for them. In former ages, when
the knowledge of science was confined to a certain class,
the commonest optical facts of the present day were
taken advantage of to delude the ignorant. The deceptions
practised by the ancient priests of Egypt,
Greece, and Rome were undoubtedly many of them of
this description. It is a well known fact that both plane
and concave metallic mirrors were used by the ancients,
and a passage in Pliny gives an account of certain glass
mirrors that were made at Sidon. Aulus Gellius, quoting
Varro, speaks of the reflecting properties of hollow
mirrors, and we shall see, as we go on, what a number
of illusions may be practised by means of a series
of plane mirrors arranged in a particular way. But we
will first devote a short time to the curious historical
facts connected with the principle of the magic lantern
which took place long before the modern invention of
this instrument by Father Kircher.</p>

<p class='c021'>Brewster says, when treating of this subject, that
there can be little doubt that the concave mirror was
the principal instrument used in connexion with the
pretended apparitions of the gods and goddesses in the
ancient temples. In the meagre history of these
apparitions that has come down to us, we can easily
perceive the traces of an optical illusion. In the
ancient temple of Hercules at Tyre, there existed a
certain seat made of consecrated stone, out of which
the gods rose, apparently at the will of the priests.
Æsculapius appeared frequently to his worshippers in
his temple in Tarsus, and the temple of Eugenium was
famous for the number of gods and goddesses which
were constantly visiting its sacred precincts. Iamblicus
tells us that the priests showed the gods to the people
in the midst of smoke; and when the great magician
Marinus terrified his auditory by suddenly showing
them the statue of Hercules in the midst of a cloud of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>incense, it was undoubtedly a woman who performed
the part, dressed up in man’s robes for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c021'>The character of these spectacles in the ancient temples
is admirably described by Damasius, and there is
no difficulty in seeing that optical illusions were the
means employed to delude the audience. He describes
the apparition on the wall of a large spot of white,
which at first appeared at a distance, but gradually
came nearer and nearer until at last it assumed the
form of a divine or supernatural being, of severe yet
mild aspect and of great personal beauty. This being
the Alexandrians immediately honoured as Osiris or
Adonis.</p>

<p class='c021'>Amongst more modern examples of this illusion may
be mentioned that of the Emperor Basil of Macedonia.
Inconsolable at the loss of his son, this potentate had
recourse to the prayers of the Pontiff Theodore Lantabaren,
who was celebrated for his power of working
miracles. The conjurer showed the Emperor the image
of his dead son magnificently attired and mounted on a
splendid war-horse. The young man dismounted, and,
going up to his father, threw himself into his arms and
disappeared. Salvertius, in speaking of this story,
observes judiciously, that the deception could only take
place through the agency of some person who closely
resembled the Emperor’s son, and that the trick would
have been easily discovered when the person embraced
the Emperor. A better explanation of the affair is,
however, afforded by supposing that the Emperor saw
an aërial image of a person resembling his son, and
that when he rushed forward to embrace him it disappeared.</p>

<p class='c021'>The accounts of the operations of the ancient magicians
are too meagre to give us any idea of the splendour
of some of these ancient ceremonies. A system
of deception such as this, employed as a means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>government, must have brought into requisition not
only the talents of all the learned men of the day, but
a crowd of accessories calculated to astonish and confound
the judgment, fascinate the senses, and facilitate
imposture.</p>

<p class='c021'>An account of an instance of modern necromancy
has been left us by Benvenuto Cellini, who played a
prominent part in a case of this sort.</p>

<p class='c021'>He accidentally made the acquaintance of a Sicilian
priest, a man of great genius and acquirements, and
well versed in Greek and Latin classical lore. One day
the conversation turned on necromancy, and the great
goldsmith told him that he had the greatest desire to
know something about this wonderful art, and that he
had felt all his life a great curiosity to penetrate its
mysteries.</p>

<p class='c021'>The priest replied, that a man ought to have a very
resolute and fearless character to study this art; but
Benvenuto answered he had both resolution and courage.
The priest went on to say, that if he had the heart to
try, he would be the means of obtaining the fulfilment
of his wishes. They consequently agreed upon a plan
of necromantic study. One evening, Benvenuto invited
one of his companions, Vincenzio Romoli, to take part
in some experiments that were to be made amongst the
ruins of the Coliseum. They there met the Sicilian
priest, who after the manner of the ancients began to
describe a number of circles in the air in the most imposing
manner. He had brought with him various gums
and perfumes, and had made a fire, into which his
assistant necromancer was to throw them at the proper
time. He commenced his conjurations, the ceremony
continuing about an hour, when there appeared legions
of demons, in such numbers that the whole of the ruins
seemed filled with them. Benvenuto was nearly fainting
with the perfumes, when the priest roused him by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>telling him to ask for something. He replied, that
he wished to be transported to the side of his Sicilian
mistress; but the demons were evidently unpropitious,
for nothing came of it. His instructor, however, told
him that they must repeat their experiments a second
time, and that Benvenuto must bring with him a child
that had never committed sin. The next time Benvenuto
took with him a boy of twelve years old whom he
had in his service, and his friends Romoli and Guddi.
When they arrived at the place of meeting, they found
the priest had made the same preparations as before.
This time, however, he used more powerful conjurations,
calling on a number of demons by their names, in Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin; so that the ruin was filled
with a still greater mass of them than on the other occasion.
The fire and perfumes were put under the
charge of Guddi and Romoli, and he gave Benvenuto a
magic picture to hold in a certain direction, the boy
being placed underneath it. The priest told him again
to wish to be in the company of his lady love, but on his
expressing the wish, the magician told him that the demons
still refused to do his bidding in this way, but that
he should visit her once more in a month’s time. The
poor boy underneath the magic picture was seized with
a terrible fright, and exclaimed, that he saw millions of
ferocious spirits and four giants, all endeavouring to
break through the magic circle the priest had formed.
All there were evidently in a most abject state of terror,
and remained in the place until the church bells began
to ring for morning prayers, when they returned home,
the boy declaring that two of the demons preceded them,
dancing and gambolling before them, and sometimes
running along the housetops.</p>

<p class='c021'>The priest then advised him to try another spiritual
<i>séance</i>, and endeavour to induce the demons to point
out sundry pots of buried gold, so that they all might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>become rich, but it does not appear that the priest’s
advice was followed.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is impossible to read the foregoing description of
what happened, without being convinced that the whole
affair was an optical illusion, and not the mere result of
the imagination of those who took part in it. The smoke
was evidently caused in order to afford a field for the
exhibition of painted images reflected by concave mirrors,
and the circle was formed in order that those
within it might be within range of the images formed on
the smoke. The mirrors reflecting the images of the
demons had undoubtedly already been arranged so that
they would fall just above the fire, and become visible
when the gums began to burn with a smoky flame. The
perfumes were simply to help to stupify the spectators,
and aid in working on their imaginations for those occurrences
which were beyond the reach of optics, for the
poor unfortunate boy saw things that his companions
did not, even to a couple of demons dancing through
the streets in broad daylight. In fact, it is somewhat
difficult to draw the line between reality and imagination
in this case. No doubt the story is considerably
exaggerated by Cellini, who was a fervid Italian, and
prone to believe in wonders, as is instanced by his wish
to study the black art. The priest, too, whom he describes
as a man of genius, no doubt had a great influence
over the famous artist, and made him see a great
deal more than was really there.</p>

<p class='c021'>The introduction of the magic lantern provided the
magicians of the seventeenth century with a very powerful
instrument with which to continue their deceptions.
The use of the concave mirror, which does not appear to
have had any accessories worth speaking of, required a
separate apartment, or at least a hiding-place of some
sort that was difficult to discover under ordinary circumstances;
but the magic lantern, inclosing as it did the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>lamp, the optical apparatus, and the figures in a comparatively
small spice, was particularly appropriate to
the wants of the Homes and Davenports of the day, who
until then had never possessed anything so convenient
and portable.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 50.</span>—Section of the Magic Lantern.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The magic lantern shown in figures 50 and 51 consists
of a dark box, containing a lamp and a concave
metallic mirror, constructed in such a way that the
whole of the rays proceeding from the lamp are reflected
through the aperture holding the optical portion of the
apparatus. In front of the box is fixed a double tube
<span class='fss'>C D</span>, one-half of which (<span class='fss'>D</span>) slides in the other. A large
plano-convex lens <i>c</i> is fixed at the inner extremity of the
double tube, and a small one at its outer end. To the
fixed tube <span class='fss'>C E</span> is attached a groove <i>b b</i>, which serves to
hold the painted glass. These glasses, or slides as they
are generally called, are painted with strong transparent
colours.</p>

<p class='c021'>The direct light of the lamp <span class='fss'>G</span>, as well as that reflected
by the mirror and passing through the lens <i>c</i>, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>so concentrated as to project a brilliant beam of light
through the painted slide, which being in the conjugate
focus of the large plano-convex lens <i>d</i>, the pictures on
the glass are refracted in a magnified form on the white
cloth <span class='fss'>P Q</span>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The magic lantern, therefore, consists of a box to hold
the lamp, a concave mirror, and a convex lens to concentrate
the light on the slide, and a second convex lens to
throw the image on the screen.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> phantasmagoria may be described as a perfected
magic lantern, and bears the same relation to its prototype
that a shilling telescope bought in the Lowther
Arcade does to one of Dollond’s or Ross’s field glasses.
The position of the spectators, too, is different, being on
the other side of the scene which receives the magnified
pictures, already described when speaking of the magic
lantern.</p>

<div id='i184'  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i184.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 52.</span>—The Phantasmagoria.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The phantasmagoria lantern is generally mounted on
a stand provided with castors so that it may be moved
about at will. It consists of a box as represented in
<a href='#i184'>fig. 52</a>, inclosing a lamp with a metallic reflector, the
bundle of rays being sent through the centre of the
tube containing the slide and lenses, as before described.
The chimney serves to carry off the products of combustion
generated by the lamp. In <a href='#i185'>fig. 53</a> we have
shown the interior of the tube containing the lenses.
Between this tube and the body of the lantern there is a
space within which slide the glasses whereon are painted
the figures and landscapes that are to be thrown on the
white screen. The luminous rays given off by the reflector
in the interior of the lantern pass through a
plano-convex lens placed with the flat side outwards.
In front comes the double convex lens, or object-glass,
which can be moved backwards and forwards by means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>of a rack and pinion. There is also a movable diaphragm,
which is worked with a couple of cords, by pulling which
the aperture is made larger or smaller at will. By
moving the lantern backwards and forwards, working
the rack and pinion and the diaphragm at the same
time, the view seen by the spectator seems to advance
and recede. The pictures are painted on glass with
transparent colours, the glasses being generally about
five inches in diameter. To render the illusion perfect
it is necessary that the spectator should be placed in a
partially dark room, being separated from the operator
by the screen already mentioned. Everything being
ready, the spectators having but little notion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>distance of the screen, a very small picture is shown to
them first, the illumination being reduced to a minimum
by pulling the cords which act on the diaphragm.
The little picture first seen by them will appear to be
situated at an enormous distance; but as the lantern is
brought almost imperceptibly nearer to the screen, the
image appears to advance towards them in a very surprising
manner, at last appearing almost as if it were
going to fall upon the spectators.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 53.</span>—The Phantascope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Robertson, an English optician who was settled in
Paris some fifty years since, was one of the first to exhibit
the phantasmagoria with success. In order to
obtain the best results he used a room some sixty or
eighty feet long, and twenty-four wide, which he hung
entirely with black. Of this a strip twenty-five feet long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>was cut off and devoted to the manipulation of the
phantasmagoria. This portion of the apartment was
separated from the spectators by a white calico screen,
tightly strained from side to side, and at first concealed
from view by a black curtain. The calico screen,
which was about twenty feet square, was well soaked in
a mixture of starch and fine gum arabic, in order to render
it semi-transparent. The floor was raised about
four or five feet at one end in order that the whole of the
spectators might have a free and uninterrupted view of
what was going on.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is undoubtedly to Robertson that we owe most of
the improvements in the phantasmagoria. The success
of his performances in Paris during the first Revolution
has never been equalled by any similar exhibition. The
enthusiasm excited amongst the Parisian public at the
time surpassed that awakened even by Cagliostro and
Mesmer. The spirit which guided Robertson in exhibiting
these wonders was totally opposed to that which
animated the two charlatans just mentioned. Robertson,
unlike them, sought to spread the notion that there was
nothing occult or supernatural in the marvels he exhibited,
but that they resulted simply from the application
of a few simple laws of optics. We shall presently
give an account of one these famous <i>séances</i>, which
were powerful enough to distract the attention of the
people of that day from the stormy events that were
going on around them; but we will first allow our
author to tell the story of his experiments in optics in
his own words.</p>

<p class='c021'>“From my very earliest infancy,” he says in his
Memoirs, “my lively and passionate imagination caused
me to be dominated over by the marvellous in a very
powerful manner. Anything that seemed to go beyond
nature in any way, excited in me an ardour which then
appeared to me capable of overcoming all obstacles in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>order to realize the effects I had conceived. Father
Kircher, it was said, believed that the magic lantern
was the invention of the Evil One. All the worse for
Father Kircher, who was gifted with a great intellect,
and many persons were tempted to say that he might
possibly have some cause for believing in the diabolical
origin of a simple optical instrument. But as the writer
who has thus reproached Father Kircher with too much
credulity has not cited those passages of the work in
which this statement may be found, I did not think seriously
of the matter. Who has not in his younger days
believed in witches, hobgoblins, and compacts with the
devil? I know I did, and worse; for I imagined and
fully believed that an innocent old woman who was a
neighbour of ours, really had dealings with Lucifer, as
every one asserted. I even went so far as to envy her
the power of conferring with the Evil One, and once
shut myself up in my room with an unhappy live cock,
whose head I cut off in the most barbarous manner,
having heard that that was the most approved manner
of summoning into one’s presence the great head of all
the demons. I waited for him several hours, calling
on him to appear, threatening to deny his existence for
the future if he did not appear, but all to no purpose.
The books on magic and the black art that I had read
had completely turned my head. I believed everything
that was in them, and I desired ardently to perform the
wonders they described, even with the aid of the devil.
The <i>Magia Naturalis</i> of Porta, and the <i>Recreations</i> of
Midorge, which treated simply of natural phenomena,
had no effect upon me, but I was at last obliged to fall
back on the principles involved in them, in order to
create the diabolical appearances I had sought after in
what I considered a truly supernatural manner, until at,
last my dwelling became a true Pandemonium.</p>

<p class='c021'>“It is only our grandmothers, it has been said for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>long time, who believe in magic, witches, and supernatural
appearances; but the statement is hardly true,
seeing how easily the country people fall a prey to the
first cheat who chooses to invest himself with supernatural
powers. We have sufficiently ridiculed the
superstitions of the ancients, and numberless instances
may be adduced which are a shame to their intelligence,
and which gives, so to speak, a denial to the stories we
have heard of their high state of civilization. But I
believe, if we were to make a collection of all the stories
of ghosts, of mysterious appearances, of communications
between the living and the departed, of the discoveries
of hidden treasures, &amp;c., &amp;c., which have taken place
even since the Revolution, before whose power so many
dark things have been brought to light, the collection
would hardly be less bulky than that of the ancient superstitions
now happily passed away.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Robertson then goes on to take great credit to himself
for showing the world that all the superstitions concerning
ghosts, spectral appearances, and other illusions
of a similar nature, were to be easily accomplished, by
simply studying natural laws. He appears first to have
begun his optical experiments with the solar microscope,
and we hear of his landlord taking an action against him
to recover damages for having pierced the doors of his
rooms with innumerable holes. He studied the subject
both theoretically and practically for many years, in
company with his friend Villette, and at last announced
a public <i>séance</i> at the Pavillon de l’Echiquier at Paris.
A multitude of advertisements and prospectuses,
written in the high-flown style of the time, were issued,
and distributed throughout the city. The newspapers
of the day are full of accounts of the extraordinary
impression made on the minds of the Parisians by
Robertson’s wonderful exhibition. The old-fashioned
word magic lantern was quite abandoned, and the new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and high sounding Greek appellation, “phantasmagoria,”
was heard issuing from every one’s mouth. There is
an amusing account given of Robertson’s exhibition in
one of the contemporary journals, written by Poultier,
one of the representatives of the people. He says: “A
decemvir of the republic has said that the dead return
no more, but go to Robertson’s exhibition and you will
soon be convinced of the contrary, for you will see the
dead returning to life in crowds. Robertson calls
forth phantoms, and commands legions of spectres. In
a well-lighted apartment in the Pavillon de l’Echiquier
I found myself seated a few evenings since, with some
sixty or seventy people. At seven o’clock a pale thin
man entered the room where we were sitting, and
having extinguished the candles he said: ‘Citizens and
gentlemen, I am not one of those adventurers and impudent
swindlers who promise more than they can perform.
I have assured the public in the <i>Journal de
Paris</i> that I can bring the dead to life, and I shall do
so. Those of the company who desire to see the
apparitions of those who were dear to them, but who
have passed away from this life by sickness or otherwise,
have only to speak, and I shall obey their commands.’
There was a moment’s silence, and a haggard
looking man, with dishevelled hair and sorrowful eyes,
rose in the midst of the assemblage and exclaimed, ‘As
I have been unable in an official journal to re-establish
the worship of Marat, I should at least be glad to see
his shadow.’ Robertson immediately threw upon a
brasier containing lighted coals, two glasses of blood, a
bottle of vitriol, a few drops of aquafortis, and two
numbers of the <i>Journal des Hommes Libres</i>, and there
instantly appeared in the midst of the smoke caused by
the burning of these substances, a hideous livid phantom
armed with a dagger and wearing a red cap of
liberty. The man at whose wish the phantom had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>been evoked seemed to recognise Marat, and rushed
forward to embrace the vision, but the ghost made a
frightful grimace and disappeared. A young man next
asked to see the phantom of a young lady whom he had
tenderly loved, and whose portrait he showed to the
worker of all these marvels. Robertson threw on the
brasier a few sparrow’s feathers, a grain or two of
phosphorus, and a dozen butterflies. A beautiful
woman, with her bosom uncovered and her hair floating
about her, soon appeared, and smiled on the young man
with the most tender regard and sorrow. A grave-looking
individual sitting close by me suddenly exclaimed
‘Heavens! it’s my wife come to life again,’ and he
rushed from the room, apparently fearing that what he
saw was not a phantom.</p>

<p class='c021'>A Swiss asked to see the shade of William Tell. The
phantom of the great archer was evoked with apparently
as much ease as the others. Delille, who was
present, called for Virgil, whose Georgics he had lately
translated. The poet appeared, having in his hand a
laurel crown, which he held out to his French commentator.
Many other equally extraordinary apparitions
were shown at the will of various individuals in the
audience, and towards the end of the evening Robertson
showed his judgment, and under very difficult circumstances.
A royalist who was present asked for the
phantom of Louis XVI., the appearance of which would
no doubt have raised a tumult amongst so many red-hot
Republicans, had not Robertson replied that before
the 18th Fructidor, the day on which the French republic
declared that royalty was abolished for ever, he
had had a receipt for bringing dead kings to life again,
but that same day he lost it, and feared that he should
never recover it again. The answer was said to have
been whispered to Robertson by his friend Ponthieu,
who saw the difficulty he was in. It was supposed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the demand was prompted by an agent of the police,
who for some cause had a spite against Robertson. In
any case the affair made such a noise that the next day
the exhibition was prohibited by those in authority,
and seals were placed upon the optician’s boxes and
papers. The exhibition was, however, afterwards allowed
to be continued, and was so successful that it had
to be transferred to the old Capuchin convent near the
Place Vendôme.</p>

<p class='c021'>The whole of Paris rang with eulogiums upon Robertson’s
wonderful exhibition at the Capuchin Convent.
He had purposely chosen the abandoned chapel, which
was in the middle of a vast cloister crowded with tombs
and funereal tablets. It was approached by a series of
dark passages, decorated with weird and mysterious
paintings, and the very door was covered with hieroglyphics.
The chapel itself was hung with black, and was
feebly illuminated by a single sepulchral lamp. The
whole assembly involuntarily remained grave and silent,
and it was only when the first preparations for the exhibition
were made, that the audience broke into a low
murmur. Robertson commenced with an address on
sorcery, magicians, witches, ghosts, and phantoms, and,
having worked the spectators up to the proper pitch, he
suddenly extinguished the single antique lamp already
mentioned, plunging the assembly into perfect darkness.
Then there arose a storm of rain, wind, thunder, and
lightning. The bells tolled lugubriously as if summoning
the dead from their tombs beneath the feet of those
present; the wind whistled mournfully, the rain fell in
torrents, the thunder rolled, and the lightnings flashed.
But suddenly above all this confusion were heard the
sweet notes of a harmonium, and in the far-off distance
the sky was seen clearing gradually. A luminous point
then made its appearance in the midst of the clouds,
which gradually became the figure of a man, increasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>in size every instant, until it seemed to be about to precipitate
itself on to the spectators. A man in the front
row was so frightened, that he uttered a scream of terror,
when the phantom instantly disappeared. A series
of spectres then issued suddenly from a cave. The
shades of great men crowded together round a boat
floating on a black and sluggish river, which the spectators
had no difficulty in identifying as the Styx. The
shadows gradually disappeared in the distance, getting
smaller and smaller until they became invisible.</p>

<p class='c021'>Robertson was extremely careful in all his entertainments
to flatter the popular ideas of the day. For instance,
one of his most famous exhibitions consisted in
a picture of a tomb, in the middle of which Robespierre
issued. The figure, as usual, walked towards the spectators;
but when apparently within a few yards of them,
it was struck down by lightning. Voltaire, Lavoisier,
Rousseau, and other popular favourites then appeared
on the scene, and disappeared again in the usual manner.
Robertson generally ended his entertainment with
an address something like the following:—</p>

<p class='c026'>“We have now seen together the wonderful mysteries
of the phantasmagoria. I have unveiled to you the
secrets of the priests of Memphis. I have shown you
every mystery of optical science; you have witnessed
scenes that in the ages of credulity would have been considered
supernatural. You have, perhaps, many of
you, laughed at what I have shown you, and the gentler
portion of my audience have possibly been terrified at
many of my phantoms; but I can assure you, whoever
you may be, powerful or weak, strong or feeble, believers
or atheists, that there is but one truly terrible spectacle—the
fate which is reserved for us all;”</p>
<p class='c027'>and at that instant a grisly skeleton was seen standing in the
middle of the hall (<a href='#i194'>fig. 54</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Even in those unbelieving days, when scepticism of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>every sort was riding rough-shod over the French people,
Robertson had the greatest difficulty in disclaiming all
approach to the possession of supernatural powers.
Day after day he received applications from all quarters
to reveal the secrets of the past, present, and future, to
describe events that were passing in other countries;
and it frequently happened, that after his entertainments,
he would be asked by several members of his
auditory to assist them in recovering property that had
been lost or stolen from them. In the latter kind of
cases he generally used to adopt the excellent plan of
sending his would-be clients to the nearest police-office.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>By</span> varying the disposition of mirrors, prisms, lenses,
and light, an infinite number of the most surprising
effects may be shown, with a comparatively small
amount of trouble and expense. We shall, therefore,
devote this chapter to the explanation of a large number
of allusions, which have been devised by Robertson and
other adepts in the art of honest deception.</p>

<p class='c021'>One of Robertson’s most famous delusions was the
“Dance of Demons,” an effect he discovered quite accidentally.
One evening, while experimenting with the
phantasmagoria, he suddenly found himself in the dark,
when two persons, each bearing a light, crossed the room
on the other side of the screen. A little window which
happened to be between the lights and the screen, immediately
threw its double image on the cloth, and the
method of multiplying shadows was discovered.</p>

<div id='i198'  class='figcenter id021'>
<img src='images/i198.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 55.</span>—Wizard Dance.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The figures used in this experiment are cut out of
fine cardboard, and may be made a foot high or there-abouts.
They are placed on a second screen in front of
the principal one, and by multiplying the lights, as
shown in <a href='#i198'>fig. 55</a>, you may have as many shadows as
you please. The effect is much heightened if the figures
are cut out so as to show as lights when thrown on the
screen. A little ingenuity shown in the arrangement of
the distance and movements of the lights, will produce an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>endless amount of amusing effects. Thus, a small image
of the principal figure may be produced by carrying the
second light to a great distance, and the lesser figure
may be easily made to jump over the former, by moving
the candle in a semicircle over the light that is stationary.
It is only necessary to recollect that whatever
movements are made by the lights, the shadows of the
figures follow their example. With a little ingenuity
the heads and limbs of the figures may be made moveable;
and if one assistant attends entirely to the working
of the figures, and the rest to the lights, an infinite
number of changes may be carried out. If mounted in
a frame, they may be made to throw somersaults, fall
down, or jump up in the air at will.</p>

<p class='c021'>A knowledge of optics will often serve to explain
with great ease the tricks played by conjurers and impostors
on princes and other great people, for their own
vile ends. It is well known that Nostradamus, on being
consulted by Marie de Médicis on the future destiny of
France, was shown by him in a mirror events that left
no doubt on her mind that she would one day share the
throne of the Bourbons. These illusions were possibly
effected in the following manner, and may be readily
understood by reference to <a href='#i201'>fig. 56</a>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The throne in the first chamber is reflected in a mirror
concealed in the canopy overshadowing a second mirror,
placed carelessly on a table in the room in which the
Princess and astrologer are standing. The arrangement
of the mirrors is such that, on looking into the smaller
glass, the Princess sees all that is going on in the adjoining
chamber. The very fact of her consulting Nostradamus
on her future fate, shows that under certain circumstances,
at least, this clever woman was as silly as
a child. It is not, therefore, to be supposed that she
would notice that the mirror she was looking into was
inclined at such an angle that it could not reflect her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>beautiful face. Nothing could be more natural, either,
than that this magic looking-glass should be placed on a
daïs, and shaded by a canopy. Nostradamus, who was
a shrewd man, could no doubt pretty well see the course
that events would take, and must consequently have
felt quite safe in showing the Princess the throne of
France occupied by Henry of Navarre. This was not
the first time that the rulers of the earth were duped by
so-called magicians, who possessed the knowledge that
the angle of reflection was always equal to the angle of
refraction.</p>

<p class='c021'>We may also mention, while speaking on this subject,
the adventure of the Emperor Alexander of Russia, <i>à
propos</i> of a singular optical experiment at which he was
present, which had for its end the changing of a man
into a wild animal, or <i>vice versâ</i>. Certain cynics will
possibly say that this is by no means difficult, and that
it is an event that happens every day; but the clever
trick at which Alexander was so astonished was not
moral but purely physical. After having gained much
money and fame in France, Robertson directed his steps
towards Hamburg, where the Emperor was at that time
stopping. He performed before the Czar an experiment
that puzzled his Majesty beyond endurance. He
showed him a man upon whose shoulders he saw successively
the head of a calf, a lion, a tiger, a bear, and a
whole menagerie of other animals. At last, the Czar
could stand it no longer, and he suddenly rose, put his
shoulder against the partition, and brought the whole
to the ground with a loud crash, just at the moment
that the confederate was assuming the form of a goat.
If our readers would like to join the Czar in his discovery
of the manner in which the trick was performed,
they can easily do so.</p>

<p class='c021'>The room in which this trick is to be performed should
have a smaller one adjoining it, about eight feet square.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The magician in the first place shows the small apartment
to the spectator, who perceives that it contains
nothing but an empty chair placed against the wall.
The partition between the two rooms is provided with
a small hole, covered with glass, exactly opposite the
chair, and at about the ordinary height of the eyes.
On the inner side there are two grooves, in which slide a
block of wood containing a prism, as shown in <a href='#i203'>fig. 57</a>,
which may be quickly and easily replaced by a piece of
plane glass. On looking through this opening, the
spectator sees a man sitting in a chair, but suddenly,
without any apparent cause, the man changes into a goat,
a sheep or some other animal. The sudden replacing
of the prism, which takes place without the spectator
perceiving it, causes him to see, not the floor with the
man and chair upon it, but the ceiling, which is carpeted
exactly in the same way, and is provided with a precisely
similar chair, upon which is placed a goat or any
other animal.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 57.</span>—The Arrangement of the Reversing Prism.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>While looking at the goat, the plane glass is substituted
for the prism, and the man reappears; another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>movement of the prism, and he changes into a sheep,
a figure of a sheep having in the meantime replaced that
of the goat. Of course it is necessary not merely to have
the walls, floors, and chairs precisely alike, but they
must each occupy the same relation to each other. If
it is desirable only to change the head, it is simply
necessary to have a lay figure with a moveable head,
dressed precisely in the same manner as the living
operator, in the upper portion of the chamber. At the
end, by the substitution of the empty chair, the individual
may be made to disappear entirely.</p>

<p class='c021'>There may often be seen in the streets of London, a
man showing a wonderful instrument, consisting of a
telescope cut in two, the two portions being separated
from each other by an interval of three or four inches.
On looking through the instrument, the spectator of
course sees the object at which it is pointed; but what
is his astonishment to find, that when the showman
places a brick between the two halves of the instrument
he sees just as well as before. The showman generally
informs him that the instrument in question has such
powerful lenses, that it will not only see through a
brick, but even through a policeman’s head if it happened
to be in the way; and the spectator, having paid
his penny, goes away perfectly mystified, until, like the
young lady who believed that all machinery was worked
“by a screw, somehow,” he comforts himself with the
idea that the trick is performed “by a mirror, somehow.”
The following figure will, however, soon clear
up the mystery.</p>

<p class='c021'>Let <span class='fss'>F M</span>, <span class='fss'>L G</span> be an ordinary telescope tube, to be
separated in the middle by an interval large enough to
insert a brick, the hand, or some other opaque object.
The whole is fixed on a stand, consisting of a square
tube with a couple of elbows to it. Between <span class='fss'>G</span> and <span class='fss'>L</span>
a mirror (<span class='fss'>A</span>) is placed diagonally, which receives the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>image of the objects to be looked at. This mirror sends
the image downwards to another placed diagonally at
<span class='fss'>C</span>, a third being placed at <span class='fss'>D</span>, and a fourth at <span class='fss'>B</span>. The
horizontal ray, meeting the mirror at <span class='fss'>A</span>, is consequently
bent downwards to <span class='fss'>C</span>, then travels horizontally to <span class='fss'>D</span>,
when it is reflected upwards to <span class='fss'>B</span>, in which it is seen by
the eye. Of course a simple tube without any lenses
at all would serve the same purpose, but the fact of its
being a telescope serves to distract the attention of the
too curious observer.</p>

<p class='c021'>Another illusion of the same kind is often practised
at fancy fairs and bazaars, when a spectator looking
into what he supposes to be an ordinary looking-glass,
sees his companions instead of himself. The way in
which this is effected is very simple. A looking-glass
is placed diagonally across a square box, the apertures
in the sides being so arranged that the spectator does
not perceive that he is looking into a glass that is placed
at an angle. Of course the exhibitor endeavours to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>show the illusion to two persons at once; and if they
are strangers to each other, and of the opposite sex, a
great deal of fun is made out of the trick. A showman
at Greenwich made an immense harvest by showing two
such mirrors, one to all the young girls who wished to
see their future husbands, and the other to all the young
men who wished to see their future wives. Of course
he had a tolerably good-looking male and female confederate
to help him. With a couple of mirrors placed
back to back in a square case, with an opening on
each side, the illusion is still more perfect, as on looking
through any of the holes the box seems to be quite
empty.</p>

<p class='c021'>The “Speaking Head” trick is performed on this
principle. When the curtain is drawn up, the audience
perceive an apparently living head placed on a small
three-legged table, the curtain at the back of the stage
being quite visible through the legs. By and by the
bodiless head, which is generally painted in a very fantastic
manner, begins to speak, answers questions, and
ends by singing a song. The trick is performed in the
following way: The spaces between the legs are filled
with a looking-glass; consequently, the spectators see
the reflection of the curtains at the <i>sides</i> of the stage,
which are made exactly like those at the back, thus
giving the table the appearance of standing on three
slim legs, with nothing between. Behind the looking-glass
there is of course plenty of space for the body of
the man belonging to the magical head. The exhibitor
naturally takes especial care never to pass in front of
the table, otherwise the lower part of his body would be
reflected in mirrors.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 60.</span>—The Polemoscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The polemoscope (from two Greek words signifying
“war” and “to see”) is another instance of double
reflection. It was said to have been invented by Helvetius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>about 1637. <a href='#i210'>Fig. 60</a> will show the principle of
this instrument.</p>

<p class='c021'>The luminous rays coming from a distant object are
received upon an inclined mirror, which is elevated
above the parapet of a fortification, and are reflected
downwards to a second, which is placed at a corresponding
angle. If necessary, lenses can be interposed, so as
to give a magnified view of the distant object that is
being examined. By means of such an instrument, the
movements of the enemy can be followed without danger,
the apparatus being generally of small size, and not
attracting notice. Amongst the varieties of this instrument,
is one whose use is readily seen by inspecting <a href='#i213'>fig. 61</a>,
by which it seems to be perfectly possible to see
with safety all that is going on outside the door of the
house without being perceived. The line of the mirrors
in this case is at right angles to that of the polemoscope
in <a href='#i210'>fig. 60</a>. Amongst the different varieties of polemoscope
which have been invented, may be mentioned a reflecting
opera-glass, which was greatly used by the
beaux and dandies of the last century. In the tube of
this instrument was inserted an inclined mirror, which
allowed the spectator to point his glass in quite a different
direction to that of the object he was really
looking at. In fact, it was constructed somewhat on
the same principle as the Herschellian or Newtonian
telescope, and enabled the possessor, while apparently
enjoying the play, to observe all that was going on in
the boxes or pit of the theatre. Years ago, there was
a little instrument of a similar kind, sold for a penny
in the streets of London, which consisted of a morsel of
looking-glass set at an angle, in a pill-box, and which
gave the possessor the power of seeing all that was
going on behind him. Persons who wear dark preservers
are often in the habit of observing all that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>going on behind their backs by the reflection seen in
the corner of their glasses.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such are the principal optical recreations founded on
the reflecting and refracting properties of mirrors and
lenses. We shall end this chapter by appending to it
the description of a few additional optical amusements
that are quite within the reach of the amateur.</p>

<p class='c021'>If the reader is in possession of a concave mirror, it
may be made the means of performing a number of
amusing experiments. In front of it is placed a plaster
head, a skull or any other object, mounted on wheels
and running along a grooved platform, which is naturally
kept perfectly concealed from the spectators. The
mirror is slightly inclined, so as to reflect the image of
the object at an angle to the observer’s eye. By running
the cast backwards and forwards, it will have the
appearance of advancing and retiring from the spectator
in a very imposing manner. A dagger may be substituted
for the cast, and by being made to work up and
down on a pivot, will have the appearance of striking
at the spectator. We have already seen that an experiment
of this sort had such an effect on Louis XIV.
that he drew his sword to defend himself from his
imaginary aggressor. There is another way of performing
this trick, by suddenly illuminating the skull
or dagger by means of a dark-coloured box containing
a light, which may be made to throw its reflections on
the object, by sliding it along a couple of wires. In
the case of the dagger, however, the hinged arrangement
will be found more effective.</p>

<p class='c021'>One of Robertson’s tricks was called the “Magic
Box,” and he astonished a numerous party of visitors
who were staying at a country house to which he had
been invited. One of the gentlemen who was always
boasting of his freedom from superstitious feelings of
any kind, had had several arguments with Robertson on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the subject of apparitions, and the latter thought that
he would at any rate surprise his strong-minded friend
by an easy trick or two. He consequently chose as his
confederate a lady to whom the gentleman had been
paying great attention during the time of his visit.
Robertson one evening mysteriously delivered a small
box to him, which he was to place upon his toilet table,
and unlock exactly at midnight. The gentleman did
so, and what was his astonishment to see the face of the
lady with whose charms he had been so deeply impressed
suddenly spring out of the box. His look of terror and
surprise was evidently too much for Robertson’s confederate,
who burst into a merry peal of laughter, leaving
her admirer in a very disconcerted state.</p>

<p class='c021'>After all we have said on the subject of mirrors, it is
not difficult to guess how this trick was performed. The
box in question was painted black on the inside, and
contained a concave mirror placed at an angle of 45°.
The reflection of the lady, who was of course in the next
room, was carried by means of several plane mirrors
placed in boxes communicating with each other through
the partition of the room, the head of the lady only being
strongly illuminated, the rest of her figure not appearing
by being kept quite dark.</p>

<p class='c021'>The figures reflected from smoke are extremely surprising.
To perform such experiments a phantasmagoria
is necessary. The focus is so adjusted that the distant
image falls just above a brasier containing lighted
charcoal. Everything being ready, a few grains of olibanum
or other gum are thrown on the coals, and the
smoke that rises immediately affords a screen for the
reflection of the images proceeding from the phantasmagoria.
If the amateur is not the possessor of a magic
lantern, a properly arranged concave mirror will answer
almost the same purpose.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Almost</span> every one in his younger days has possessed
and broken that pretty instrument known as the kaleidoscope.
His researches into its construction no doubt
taught him that it consisted of a cylindrical tube in tin
or cardboard, with a moveable cap at one end and a
small hole at the other. In the interior of the tube
were found three long glasses, blackened on the back,
placed at an angle, and kept in position by pieces of
cork. The moveable cap was provided with two circular
pieces of glass, one ground and the other transparent,
between which were placed a number of pieces
of coloured glass. On holding the instrument up to
the light and looking through the eye-hole, a beautifully
coloured star was seen whose form and hue
changed by simply shaking the tube.</p>

<p class='c021'>The kaleidoscope was invented by Sir David Brewster,
and is exceedingly simple in principle. We all know
that if a luminous object, such as a taper, is placed before
a mirror, it gives forth rays of light in all directions.
Amongst these luminous rays, those that fall on
the surface of the mirror are, of course, reflected in such
a manner that the angle of reflection is equal to the
angle of incidence. If another mirror be placed at right
angles to the first, and an object be put in the angle,
the image of it will be multiplied four times. If the
angle be diminished to 60°, six reflections will be seen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>and so on. A symmetrical figure is constantly obtained,
forming in one case a cross composed of four similar
portions; in the other a triple star, the halves of each
ray being similar. It is the symmetry of the figure that
gives the pleasing effect. In the ordinary kaleidoscope
the angle made by the reflecting surfaces is thirty degrees,
and a star of six rays is formed, the halves of
each ray being alike. The figures formed in the kaleidoscope
are simply endless; and if the space between
the glasses in the moveable cap be filled with bits of
opaque as well as transparent substances, the varieties
of light and shade may be added to those of colour. It
was at one time the fashion to copy the images
formed in the kaleidoscope as patterns for room papers,
muslins, curtains, shawls, and other similar fabrics, but
thanks to the spread of artistic taste in this country the
decorative designer now relies more on his own talent
than any aid he may receive from optical instruments.</p>

<p class='c021'>Plane mirrors, as we have seen, reflect objects upright
and symmetrical, reversing only the sides. Concave
mirrors reverse them, and if they are not placed
exactly in the proper focus, distort them by making one
portion appear smaller than the other; while convex
mirrors reflect them in an upright position, but also
similarly slightly distorted. But when the mirror is
not a portion of a sphere, like those whose properties
we have been considering, the distortion is increased to
so great an extent as to deform the object so that it is
difficult to recognise its nature from its reflection. We
all know the distortion that our face undergoes when
reflected from the shining surface of a teapot or spoon,
and the cylindrical mirrors that hang in the shop windows
of many opticians are the source of much amusement
to the passers by, whose physiognomies are shown
to them either lengthened to many times their natural
size, or widened to an extent that is ludicrously hideous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>according to the position in which the mirror is
hung. Such distortions are known to opticians as <i>anamorphoses</i>,
from two Greek words signifying the destruction
of form; and distorted drawings used to be
sold at one time which when reflected from the surface
of the cylindrical mirror, became perfectly symmetrical.
Anamorphic drawings may be also made, which when
looked at in the ordinary manner appear distorted, but
when viewed from a particular point have their symmetry
restored to them. With a little knowledge of drawing,
it is not difficult to produce these in great variety.</p>

perpendicular line to <span class='fss'>V</span>, and cross it by a line <i>e d</i>
parallel to <i>a b</i>. Lastly, draw <span class='fss'>V S</span> horizontal to <i>e d</i>.
The length of the two lines <i>e</i> <span class='fss'>V</span> and <span class='fss'>S V</span> is quite arbitrary,
but the longer you make the former in proportion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>latter the greater will be the distortion of the drawing.
Now draw the lines <span class='fss'>V</span> 1, <span class='fss'>V</span> 2, <span class='fss'>V</span> 3, and <span class='fss'>V</span> 4, and join <span class='fss'>S</span>
to <i>a</i>. Wherever <span class='fss'>S</span> <i>a</i> crosses the divisions 1, 2, <i>e</i>, 3, 4,
and <i>b</i>, draw a horizontal line, parallel of course with
<i>a b</i>. You will thus have a trapezium <i>a b c d</i> divided
into as many spaces as the square <span class='fss'>A B C D</span> in <a href='#i218'>fig. 62</a>,
and it now remains to fill them in with similar portions
of the figure. Thus, for instance, the nose is in the
fourth vertical division, starting from the left, and in
the third and fourth counting from the top; in order,
therefore, to make it occupy so lengthened a space it
must be considerably distorted by the pencil. It will
be readily seen also that the more numerous the spaces
into which the square is divided, the easier it will be
to draw the distorted picture. It is by this means that
the <i>anamorphosis</i> shown in <a href='#i220'>fig. 63</a> has been drawn.</p>

<p class='c021'>The next thing to do is to find the point of view
from which we can see the figure in its natural proportions.
This will be found to be at a distance above the
point <span class='fss'>V</span> equal to the line <span class='fss'>V S</span>. In order to complete the
experiment it is simply necessary to place the distorted
picture in a horizontal position, and fix a piece of cardboard
vertically at the point <span class='fss'>V</span>. If a hole be punched
in it at a distance from <span class='fss'>V</span> equal to <span class='fss'>S</span>, and the drawing
be looked at through it, the whole of the parts will fall
into symmetry immediately.</p>

<p class='c021'>The experiment may be tried first with <a href='#i225'>fig. 63</a>, the
hole being made rather large, and the eye placed at a
distance of from 3 to 4 inches.</p>

<p class='c021'>It would be difficult, without having recourse to
geometrical formulæ, to explain how it happens that
by placing the eye at a particular point the distorted
lines of the drawing become symmetrical; but perhaps
a mechanical demonstration will help to make this
difficult subject a little plainer.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 63.</span>—Anamorphosis.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Draw in outline any figure upon a piece of cardboard,
and make a series of pin-holes along the most prominent
lines of the drawing, taking care that they are pretty
close together. Place the perforated card in a vertical
position on a sheet of paper, so that the rays from a
candle or lamp may fall, on the flat surface beneath. On
looking at the luminous figure formed from the drawing,
you will find that it is as much distorted as the lady’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>head in <a href='#i220'>fig. 63</a>, and that the lower you place the candle
the greater will be the deformity. You may if you
please, trace the luminous figure on the paper, and the
result will appear distorted when looked at in the ordinary
manner, but symmetrical when viewed from the
point at which the flame of the candle was placed.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the foregoing experiments we have spoken of the
anamorphic drawings as being placed in a horizontal
position, but they may be looked at just as well vertically,
the card with the hole being in this instance horizontal.
It is also not necessary that the point of sight
(<span class='fss'>V</span>, <a href='#i220'>fig. 63</a>) should be in the centre of the picture; it
may be placed at one side or the other, care being
taken to draw all the divisional lines so that they meet
at this particular spot. A few experiments with a candle
and a perforated figure will soon show the student
how to accomplish this.</p>

<p class='c021'>Anamorphoses by reflection may be prepared, if this
principle is carried out, which appear a mass of confused
lines until they are reflected in a cylindrical mirror.
Formerly opticians were accustomed to construct
anamorphoses which became symmetrical pictures when
viewed in a conical mirror; but the fashion for such
toys appears to have gone out. Such drawings were
extremely difficult to make, and the mirrors, having to
be ground and polished with great care, were very expensive.</p>

<p class='c021'>Some experimentalists have carried the subject so
far that, by looking at the drawing of an object in particular
positions, it changed into quite a different subject.
In the cloister of an abbey that once existed in
Paris, there were two anamorphoses of this kind. They
were the work of a certain Father Niceron, who has
left behind him a treatise in Latin on optical wonders,
entitled <i>Thaumaturgus Opticus</i>, which contains a long
essay on anamorphoses. One of these pictures represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>St. John the Evangelist writing his Gospel; the
other Mary Magdalene. When looked at in the ordinary
manner, they appeared to be landscapes; but
when the observer placed himself in a particular position,
they changed into the figures we have mentioned.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>While</span> upon the subject of optical wonders, we
should hardly be forgiven if we did not give a description
of the amusement known as Chinese shadows, or
Fantocini. In the winter time it is difficult to pass
through any of the large thoroughfares of London after
nightfall, without seeing a crowd admiring the popular
fantocini farces of the “Broken Bridge,” or “Billy
Button;” and although these dramatic exhibitions are
not always free from vulgarity, they are received with
vociferous applause by at least the younger portion of
the audience.</p>

<p class='c021'>The apparatus for the exhibition of the fantocini is
generally very simple. The screen on which they are
shown is generally made of calico rendered semi-transparent
with copal varnish, and the figures are cut out
of cardboard. Frames containing landscapes and scenes
of different kinds are also provided, which are cut out
in the same material. The <i>dramatis personæ</i> are generally
made with moveable limbs, which they throw about
in the most unanatomical manner, and the showman is
often endowed with ventriloquial talents of no mean order.
This amusement is to be found in all parts of the
world, from the Strand and Tottenham Court Road
London, to the streets of Algiers and Java. A graphic
writer in the <i>Magasin Pittoresque</i> gives a pleasant description
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of the fantocini, as exhibited at the Arabs’
theatre in the Mohammedan quarter of the city of Algiers.
It was on the occasion of the feast of the Bairam,
which immediately follows the termination of the
Ramadan, or Mohammedan Lent. The theatre, which
was the only one frequented by the Arab population,
consisted simply of a long vaulted hall, without seats,
boxes, or galleries; but the audience, who had already
been there some time, did not seem to regard the omission
as of any consequence, but had seated themselves
on the ground with great coolness, chatting in whispers,
and waiting patiently until the director should consider
the place full enough to begin the performance. Half
an hour elapsed, and the spectators still chatted on
quite unconcernedly; an hour, and yet there was no
hissing or stamping of feet from the grave and patient
spectators. At last they reached the maximum, and a
boy came forward and blew out the few lamps with
which the theatre was lighted, leaving them to smoulder
away with a perfume that was certainly not Oriental in
its character. First came the legend of the Seven
Sleepers; then Scheherazade relating her bewitching
stories to the Sultan. These were followed by Aladdin
and the Wonderful Lamp, a story that is as popular in
Algiers as it is in London or Paris; the whole culminating
in a kind of burlesque, in which a great deal of
gross fun was mixed up with a number of rebellious allusions.
The devil, for instance, who is of course one
of the members of the troupe, is portrayed as a French
soldier, bearing a cross on his breast like an ancient
Crusader. After him came Carhageuse, who is the
buffoon of the Eastern stage, and who makes violent
but unsuccessful love to a charming young Jewess.
There was a poor barber who was raised to the dignity
of grand vizier, his successor’s head being cut off by the
yataghan of the Oriental Jack Ketch, to the great delight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>of the people. Then a wretched Jew receives the
bastinado, amidst vociferous applause, which increases
still higher when the ears of an unhappy Giaour are cut
off and thrown to the dogs. Throughout the piece, it
is of course the Mussulman who always triumphs, like
the French guards at the <i>Cirque Impériale</i>, or the British
grenadiers at old Astley’s. The performance concluded
with a grand naval battle between the Moorish
and Spanish fleets. The drum as usual served for cannon,
there was a great deal of smoke and confusion,
and the Christian fleet gradually sank under the continuous
fire of the Mussulmans amidst the plaudits and
bravos of the crowd.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 64.</span>—Effect of cut paper-work.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In Java, the subjects of the fantocini are generally
taken from the native mythology. The screen on which
the shadows are exhibited is ten or twelve feet long,
and five feet high, and the figures are cut of thick
leather, their limbs being moved by thin pieces of nearly
transparent horn.</p>

<p class='c021'>In <a href='#i225'>fig. 64</a> we see another kind of Chinese shadows,
in which the lights of the figure are cut out. These
pictures are perfectly unrecognisable as being even the
basest imitation of any known form; but when their
shadows are thrown on the wall, the cut-out portions
show us lights, whilst those that have been left form
the shadows. On the Boulevard des Capucines, at
Paris, there used to be a man who managed to pick up
a good living by selling these candle shadows. Of course
he used to carry on his trade of an evening, and with
a strong lamp he would throw the shadows of his
figures on the white walls of the houses, or the blind of
a shop window, or even on the pavement. With a little
care and ingenuity a number of these amusing cards
may be easily designed. In showing them, care must
be taken to choose the best distances between the light
and the paper, and between this latter and the wall.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>If the card be placed too close to the wall, the resulting
shadows will be too dark, and the outlines too sharp;
if, on the contrary, the light is placed too far off, the
outlines become confused, and the proper effect is
lost.</p>

<p class='c021'>Shadows have been applied before now to the propagation
of seditious ideas. “In 1817,” says an esteemed
French author, “one winter’s night we were all sitting
round the table listening to my father, who was reading
aloud an interesting book of the period, when a friend
of our family, who had been formerly an officer of the
Empire, entered the room. He was a serious, upright,
soldierly man, and wore his coat buttoned up to his
chin. He had hardly replied to our salutations, when
he drew a chair to the table, and made a sign with his
hands and eyes that plainly indicated silence and discretion.
There was something in the expression of his
countenance that seemed to show that he had something
mysterious in store for us, and we fully expected to hear
some extraordinary news, or to see him bring out a
Bonapartist pamphlet of more than usual importance.
Our surprise was consequently great when we saw him
slowly unscrew the top of his cane, which was turned
out of boxwood, and presented nothing very remarkable
either in form or material. He, however, took up a
copybook which was lying on the table, placed it at a
certain distance from the lamp, and then laid upon it
the little piece of turned boxwood. At first we noticed
nothing at all extraordinary, and he smiled at our want
of intelligence, until at last my youngest brother cried
out suddenly, ‘Look! there’s the head of Napoleon!’
and truly enough, we found, on looking more attentively
at the shadows of the turned knob of the cane, that their
profile was that of the great exile, most correctly and
clearly portrayed. The old captain’s face lighted up at
the sight, and the tears came into his eyes. ‘We shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>see him again,’ he murmured in a low voice, and he
hummed the burden of a Bonapartist song then in
vogue. During the rest of the evening he was very
lively, and proved to us most conclusively, that before
six months the <i>Grande Armée</i> would be revenged for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>their defeat at Waterloo. Some weeks after, there was
hardly a soldier in the town that did not possess a stick
or a tobacco-pipe stopper, turned in this fashion, but
one day a panic seized everybody, and the canes and
pipe stoppers were all burnt.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> description of the polyorama naturally follows
that of the phantasmagoria, being a practical application
of precisely the same principles. In the case of
the polyorama, however, two or even more lanterns of
the best construction, are used. There are therefore
two sets of lenses identical in every particular, placed
side by side, in the same line, the foci of both being
adjusted for the same spot, so that the images refracted
from each may superpose each other without difficulty.
In each instrument there are the same pictures, but
they differ in certain particulars, as we shall see presently.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the phantascopes shown in <a href='#i184'>figs. 52</a> and <a href='#i194'>54</a> there
are two sets of lenses; the first carries a glass bearing
the image of a skeleton in a winding sheet, while on the
glass belonging to the second a naked skeleton is portrayed.
If, therefore, at a given instant the first lantern
is shut off, the spectators see the winding sheet
torn, as it were, suddenly from the spectre before them.
The first lantern being turned on once more, the skeleton
is instantly reclothed in its hideous garb.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is of course not necessary always to choose such
horrible subjects for representation, as it is possible
to produce changes of a much more agreeable nature.
For instance, a volcano may be depicted during its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>tranquillity, with the sun shining on its verdant sides,
and surmounted with a gently rising wreath of smoke.
Then it may be shown at night, with its crater vomiting
flames and red-hot stones, while streams of lava are
flowing beneath. By proper mechanism, one lantern
may be gradually shut and the other as gradually
opened, producing an effect that appears perfectly
natural, from the gentle change which takes place.
Daylight, twilight, and moonlight effects may be easily
made to succeed each other in their proper order, and
the most opposite scenes may be made to change each
other by proper appliances. Those who have seen the
dissolving views at the Polytechnic, know what effects
are produced by this very simple means. A virgin
forest changes to a crowded church, which in turn dissolves
into a scene on the Alps.</p>

<p class='c021'>The diorama, properly so called, invented by the illustrious
Daguerre, differs completely in principle from
the apparatus we have just been describing. As its
etymology indicates, the pictures shown are seen
<i>through</i>. As in the case of the polyorama, there are
two different effects painted upon the cloth, which are
brought out by a double system of illumination.</p>

<div id='i234'  class='figcenter id021'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 66.</span>—Diorama.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Fig. 66 will show the way in which these changes are
managed. The large picture, which is hanging vertically,
is painted both in front and behind. The front
is illuminated by reflection from a semi-transparent
screen placed over it, which receives the light of the
floor above. The back is lighted from the windows behind,
which are provided with blinds to regulate the
amount of light. The effects produced by the diorama
were truly marvellous, and Daguerre had a special talent
for this kind of painting. His famous <i>Midnight
Mass</i>, which was exhibited at the Regent’s Park, was
one of the most renowned of his works. The scene first
represented a dark, empty church, feebly lighted by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>small altar lamp, but gradually the lights appeared here
and there, worshippers congregated in front of the altar,
filling the nave and aisles. In Paris the same
scene was exhibited, representing the interior of the
Church of St. Germain l’Auxerrois with such perfect
reality, that a countryman actually threw a halfpenny
against the painted canvas, to see whether he were
really in a church or not.</p>

<p class='c021'>The next scene represented the destruction of the
village of Goldau, near Lucerne, by a landslip. First
there appeared a smiling fertile valley, its sides crowned
with verdure; a storm gradually rose, the rain fell, the
wind blew, the lightnings flashed, and the thunder rolled
in the distance. Darkness at last closed in, and when
the sun once more rose over the valley, nothing was to
be seen but a mass of fallen rocks.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Having</span> devoted so much space in the preceding
chapters to optical amusements of a purely recreative
character, it is only right that we should now say a few
words on certain instruments of a less frivolous character
than those we have lately been considering, and which
deserve at our hands the most serious attention. We
shall, therefore, in the present chapter, speak of an ingenious
instrument which serves to show in relief the
images of objects depicted on a flat surface. We have
already seen, that although we have two eyes, provided
with lenses and screens by means of which the images
of things around us are formed, we only perceive
a single object; and the student has no doubt long
since wondered why nature has bestowed two eyes upon
us, when only one would have apparently served the
same purpose. This question was for a long time a
complete puzzle to philosophers, and it was not until
Professor Wheatstone made his experiments on binocular
vision in 1838, that the matter received a satisfactory
explanation. He showed that each eye receives a different
impression of any object upon the retina, and that
it is in consequence of the union of these slightly dissimilar
images that the sensation of relief is experienced.
A one-eyed man or a Cyclops would only partially
perceive relief in the objects presented to his view, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>consequence of a single image being sent to his brain.
He would, no doubt, after examining the things he saw
with his hands, know they were solid, and generally see
them so; but if a new object were presented to his view
he would have some difficulty in knowing whether it
had a flat surface or not.</p>

<div id='i237'  class='figcenter id025'>
<img src='images/i237.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 67.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The principle of binocular vision may be explained
as follows: If a playing die, such as is represented in
fig. 67, be held out at arm’s length in the position indicated
in the figure, and looked at first with the left eye
and then with the right, we shall find that in the first
case we see a little of the three dots on the left-hand
side, and in the second we lose sight of the three dots
and see a little of the single one on the right-hand side.
The images seen by each eye are, therefore, slightly dissimilar,
and it stands to reason that, if by any means we
can combine two slightly dissimilar flat pictures of a
solid object, we shall see it in relief. This was proved
practically by Professor Wheatstone, who constructed
an instrument capable of effecting the desired union,
and which has since been called the stereoscope, from
two Greek words signifying ‘to see solid.’ The instrument
remained for a long time fallow, so to speak, from the
difficulty of drawing two pictures that should be identical
in size and details, although dissimilar in the
arrangement of their perspective. It was, therefore, not
until photography enabled us to do this with the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>ease and exactitude that the stereoscope became common.
The instrument first devised by Professor Wheatstone,
was what is termed a reflecting stereoscope, and
was expensive to make and cumbrous to use. It was
modified by Sir David Brewster, by the substitution of
prisms for reflectors, and was thus made cheaper and
more portable. The refracting form of stereoscope is
so familiar to most people, that it really needs no
description. It will only be necessary to mention that
the prisms used in the eye-pieces are made by cutting
a double convex lens in two, and reversing the halves.
They are so placed that the centre of each prism is just
in the centre of each eye; but as the eyes of different
people vary in distance, an arrangement is generally
added so that the eye-pieces may slide from side to side.
Being cut from lenses, the prisms have a magnifying
power; consequently other means are provided for
sliding them up and down to suit the length of focus
in different eyes.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>In <a href='#i239'>fig. 69</a> we can follow the path of the rays proceeding
from each picture, and reach the eyes apparently
from a spot exactly between the two.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the reflecting stereoscope two mirrors are joined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>together at right angles to each other, the two pictures
being placed at each side, at a distance corresponding
to their size. The reflecting instrument, although not
so portable, is in some sort superior to the other,
inasmuch as pictures of any size can be seen by it,
whilst in the smaller instrument the size of the photograph
is limited by the distance at which the eyes are
placed.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 69.</span>—The Principle of the Refracting Stereoscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It should be mentioned, that no optical instrument of
any kind is absolutely necessary to obtain a stereoscopic
effect from two suitable drawings or photographs, as it
is quite possible by a little management of the eyes to
cause the two images to combine with each other. Referring
again to <a href='#i237'>fig. 67</a>, it will be perceived that the
two figures of the dice are about an inch and a half
from each other. Holding the book at about ten inches
from the eye, they are viewed by squinting strongly
until the <i>right</i> eye looks at the <i>left</i> die, and the <i>left</i> eye
at the right. This may be also done by converging the
eyes on a point beyond the centre of the figure, which
may be easily done by looking at a point midway between
the two. In both cases the images at first appear doubled,
and we see four dice, but a little practice will soon
enable you to cause the two inside images to coalesce,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and so give the effect of relief. It is true that even then
three images are seen, but the eye soon grows accustomed
to neglect them altogether. This habit is a very
pleasant acquirement for the London <i>flâneur</i>, who can
thus see in perfection the numberless stereoscopic views
now shown in our shop-windows without the intervention
of an instrument of any kind.</p>

<p class='c021'>The method of photographing subjects for the stereoscope
is very simple, and consists in taking two views
of the object to be depicted, from two different points.
According to the distance of these points from each
other, so will the resulting pictures appear in greater or
less relief. This is readily seen in some stereoscopic
portraits which have been taken at a large angle, and
consequently show such increased relief as to produce
distortion. Theoretically, the interval of the two points
of view ought to be two inches and a half, that being
the average distance between the two eyes; but in
practice it is better to increase it in the case of portraits
or other near objects to about twelve inches, and in that
of views to even several feet. Brewster’s original rule
for taking stereoscopic photographs, was to place the
cameras one foot apart for every twenty-five feet of distance.
The beautiful stereoscopic pictures of the moon
photographed by Mr. Warren de la Rue were taken at
more than 1,000 miles’ distance, in order to obtain the
necessary relief. The principle of the stereoscope has
received many useful applications in the way of book
illustrations, art teaching, and anatomical demonstration,
and has thus gained a position among philosophical
instruments that it did not at first possess.</p>

(<a href='#i055'>fig. 4</a>) and stereoscope, has resulted in the
invention of an instrument called the stereotrope. A
number of binocular photographs of some object in
motion—a steam-engine, for instance—are taken when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the moving parts are in different positions, and mounted
on two revolving discs, the images being combined by
means of a pair of semi-lenses, as in the ordinary refracting
stereoscope.</p>

<p class='c021'>We cannot leave this subject without describing the
pseudoscope, also the invention of Professor Wheatstone.
If a stereoscopic pair of photographs of some
solid body—a ball, for instance—are mounted the reverse
way, that is to say, if the picture intended to be
looked at by the right eye is placed on the left, the
relief of the object will be reversed, and the ball will
appear as a hollow hemisphere. If, therefore, we can
by means of lenses or prisms cause the image of any
natural object, as seen by the right eye, to be conveyed
to the left, and <i>vice versâ</i>, we shall see the relief reversed.
A conical cap will appear in relief as a cone, a globe
will look like a hollow sphere, and the human face will
take the semblance of the inside of a mask. The same
deception may be effected by looking at a seal through
a short-focused lens, so that the image shall seem reversed.
In this case, the light coming apparently from
the wrong side, and shining on the parts in relief, gives
them the appearance of being hollow. An intaglio
will, of course, appear in relief when so looked at.
Photographs of gems and bas-reliefs will also present
a pseudoscopic appearance, if looked at in a light
coming from the opposite side to that in which they
were taken. The same appearance may be seen sometimes
in wall papers having patterns painted in strong
relief.</p>

  <h2 id='ch3-08' class='c012'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><span class='c020'>THE CAMERA OBSCURA AND CAMERA LUCIDA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> construction of the camera obscura is founded
on the fact that the rays of light, when collected
into a point either by being passed through a small
hole or a converging lens, form an image of the objects
from which they proceed at the point of meeting.
This may be readily tried by piercing the shutter of a
room with a small hole, and holding a piece of paper
within a short distance of it. It will be noticed that
the smaller the hole the more distant will be the
image formed. The first person who observed this fact
was John Baptist Porta, an Italian philosopher who
lived in the latter part of the seventeenth century. He
noticed that when a screen was placed opposite a small
hole in the shutter of his room, the objects outside were
depicted on it in a reversed position with moderate distinctness;
but that when a biconvex lens was placed
over the hole, the picture was rendered much more
distinct. This was the first attempt at the formation of
the camera obscura, an instrument that has since bestowed
such incalculable benefits on humanity.</p>

<div id='i243'  class='figcenter id021'>
<img src='images/i243.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 70.</span>—The Camera Obscura.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The shape of the images so formed is independent of
the shape of the opening, which, as long as it is sufficiently
small, may be square, oval, or triangular. This
may be easily seen when the sun shines through the
intervals between the leaves of a shady avenue or bower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>of trees. The image of the sun as a circular patch of
light is seen scattered over the surface of the ground,
although the accidental intervals formed by the leaves
above were of a thousand different shapes. These
images at the time of an eclipse of the sun are very
surprising, taking, as they do, the form of a crescent,
more or less large according to the magnitude of the
eclipse.</p>

<p class='c021'>This property possessed by the rays of light, of depicting
on a screen the forms and colours of the objects
from which they proceed when passed through a small
aperture or a lens, is taken advantage of in most places
famous for their natural scenery. The apparatus employed
for this purpose is comparatively simple, consisting
merely of a dark wooden hut, with a whitened table
in the centre, and a mirror and lens in the apex of the
roof. In <a href='#i243'>fig. 70</a> we have a section of a camera obscura
of this kind. The mirror and lens at the top of the
apparatus are made to revolve, so as to bring every part
of the landscape into view in turn. A camera obscura
in a position commanding a view of moving objects,
such as ships sailing to and fro, or the busy streets of
a populous town, is an unending source of amusement,
and may be easily and cheaply constructed.</p>

<p class='c021'>The camera obscura has been much utilized for taking
hasty but exact sketches of various places. For this
purpose it is made very light, and mounted on three legs
carrying at their junction a flat table, whereon is placed
the paper to receive the drawing. The tripod is covered
with a black curtain, which, falling over the artist,
effectually excludes all the rays of light except those
which pass through the lens and are reflected downwards
by the mirror. In the better kind of apparatus the
mirror is replaced by a prism, which throws a clearer
image than a mirror upon the screen.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is on these properties of the camera obscura that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the art of photography was founded. Everybody who
saw the beautiful images formed by this instrument was
struck with the idea that by some means or other they
could be fixed on paper. After numberless attempts the
long-wished-for goal was at length arrived at; and now
optics, aided by chemistry, is enabled to depict for us
natural objects of every kind, from the distorted limb
of the hospital patient to the beautiful forms of the
queens and empresses of the world—from the tiniest
animalcule to the great sun itself, who is compelled by
the might of science to paint his own portrait for us
with all his faults and imperfections.</p>

<p class='c021'>The lenses used for photographic purposes have only
reached their present state of perfection after ceaseless
labours of the philosophers and opticians of all countries.
At first only a single lens was used, but it was
found that the rays which exercised a chemical action
did not meet in the same point as the rays of light, for
it must be remembered that it is not the light we see
that acts upon the substances used in photography, but
another influence, known as actinism. It was also
found that a single lens would not give a flat picture
when the whole of its aperture was used, the edges of
the image being always blurred and indistinct. This
latter defect was found to be partially obviated by decreasing
the opening, but this remedy shut off the light
and prolonged the process. Gradually these two defects
were removed, and now every photographer, no
matter how humble, is possessed of a lens capable of
taking a clear picture, every detail of which is perfectly
distinct and faithful.</p>

<p class='c021'>The camera lucida bears a great analogy to the camera
obscura in the purpose for which it is used, though
not in the principle on which it is constructed. It is
employed, like the preceding instrument, for obtaining
faithful copies of a landscape, a building, or even of another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>drawing. It was invented by Dr. Wollaston, in
1804, and consists of a little four-sided prism, of which
fig. 71 is a section.</p>

<p class='c021'>The angle at <span class='fss'>A</span> is a right angle; the angle <span class='fss'>B</span> measures
67½°, the angle <span class='fss'>C</span> 135°, and the angle <span class='fss'>D</span> is, of course,
equal to <span class='fss'>B</span>. It is mounted on a sliding foot, so that it
may be raised or lowered at will, or turned in a horizontal
direction. The path of the rays in this case is
easy to follow, the object to be copied being placed at
<span class='fss'>L</span>, and the eye at <span class='fss'>I</span>. On looking downwards the image
of the object to be drawn is seen on the paper; and if
the eye is placed so that the edge of the prism will just
cut the pupil in two, the paper and pencil will be seen
at the same time. It will be seen from the diagram,
that the rays proceeding from <span class='fss'>L</span> strike on the surface <span class='fss'>A
B</span> at right angles, and, being then reflected from <span class='fss'>C B</span>,
pass upwards again to point <span class='fss'>E</span>. The direction of the
rays is in reality a little more complicated than this.
In the case of distant objects it is impossible to see
both the object and the pencil at the same time; a lens
is sometimes introduced at <span class='fss'>I</span> to modify this defect. The
original instrument has also been modified by the introduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of a triangular prism, in conjunction with plates
of coloured glass, but the difficulty of rendering the
image and the paper of the same strength is very great.
The instrument is also hard to use, from the additional
difficulty of always keeping the head in the same position,
for the least movement from left or right is sufficient
to throw the whole drawing out.</p>

<p class='c021'>A simple camera lucida may be made out of a small
piece of looking-glass, mounted at an angle of 45°, or
half-way between the horizontal and the perpendicular.
If this be turned towards the drawing or view to be
copied, and the left eye applied to the mirror, the image
of the object will be seen on the paper below, and the
pencil may be guided with the right. The proper use
of this simple little instrument depends in a great measure
upon the focus of each eye being the same. The
light falling on the paper, too, requires very careful
adjusting, otherwise the brighter object will eclipse the
other. It is a good plan, too, to whiten the pencil or
pen used, so that it may not so easily be lost when drawing
the brighter parts of the object. We have seen
excellent drawings made from plants by means of a
little instrument of this kind, which simply consisted
of a piece of looking-glass inserted in a cork stuck in a
glass bottle.</p>

  <h2 id='ch3-09' class='c012'>CHAPTER IX.<br /><span class='c020'>THE SPECTROSCOPE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>We</span> now come to speak of an instrument which may
fairly rank, after the telescope and microscope, as one
of the most wonderful discoveries of modern optical
science. By its means we have not only discovered
four new elementary bodies, which are found in certain
minerals in inconceivably small quantities, but we have
also determined the chemical composition of some of
the remotest stars and nebulæ.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1701 Newton discovered that if an ordinary ray
of white light was admitted through a small hole into a
dark chamber, and thence passed through a triangular
prism, it became decomposed into a coloured band,
known as the solar spectrum. As we have already explained
that this decomposition is caused by the different
coloured rays that make up white light being bent unequally
by the action of the prism, we trust the following
explanations will be readily understood. In 1802
Dr. Wollaston, an English philosopher, discovered that
by using a narrow slit, instead of a round hole, the resulting
spectrum was no longer continuous, but was
divided at intervals by dark lines extending across it in
a direction parallel to the edges of the prism. These
lines attracted considerable attention at the time, but it
was not until 1815, that Fraunhofer, an optician of
Munich, investigated them with accuracy. He mapped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and counted no less than six hundred of them, identifying
eight of the most conspicuous by the first eight
letters of the alphabet. Their positions are as follows:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c028'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A.  Beginning of red.</div>
      <div class='line'>B.  Middle of red.</div>
      <div class='line'>C.  Beginning of orange.</div>
      <div class='line'>D.  Middle of yellow.</div>
      <div class='line'>E.  Middle of green.</div>
      <div class='line'>F.  Beginning of blue.</div>
      <div class='line'>G.  Middle of indigo.</div>
      <div class='line'>H.  Middle of violet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The designations of these lines have been retained to
the present day, and they have been named after the
Munich philosopher, being known as Fraunhofer’s lines.
They are to be seen in all parts of the spectrum, and
increase in number and fineness according as the width
of the slit through which the light passes is diminished.
It may be asked, how it happens that they increase in
proportion to the narrowness of the aperture admitting
the light? A little consideration will soon show the
reason of this.</p>

<p class='c021'>When a beam of light is passed through a hole of, let
us say, the eighth of an inch in diameter and decomposed
by a prism, the spectrum so produced is imperfect,
inasmuch as an infinite number of spectra are thus superposed,
and for this reason, that the rays of light
entering on the right side of the aperture will give a
spectrum falling in a different place to that formed by
the rays entering on the left. In order, therefore, to
diminish the confusion caused by the superposition of a
number of spectra, the aperture ought to be reduced to
a narrow slit. When the thin slice of light passing
through the slit is decomposed by the prism, we find
that not only is the purity of the colours greatly increased,
but the lines in question make their appearance
more or less in all parts of the coloured band.</p>

<p class='c021'>These lines are very unequally distributed, some being
crowded together in masses, while others are extremely
faint, and are separated by large intervals. Their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>position is well marked and determined, no matter from
what source we obtain our beam of sunlight. Whether
the spectrum be produced from the sun itself, or from
the reflected light proceeding from the moon or planets,
they are still found in the same place; only that in the
latter case they are not so numerous, on account of the
light being much fainter. For many years the cause of
these lines remained a complete mystery, and it was not
until Bunsen and Kirchhoff undertook their investigation
that a satisfactory explanation of their origin was arrived
at. In order to explain this, we must consider
briefly the properties of the spectra of flames, and other
luminous bodies.</p>

<p class='c021'>If, instead of the light of the sun, we examine prismatically
the light given off by an incandescent body,
such as a white-hot piece of platinum, we shall find that
the lines seen in the solar spectrum are absent, and that
we have a continuous band of coloured light quite uninterrupted
by dark spaces or bands. The same absence
of lines is seen in the spectra of the electric light and
the flame of an ordinary candle, the light in each of
these cases being produced by particles of carbon in a
state of vivid incandescence. But if we examine the
flame of incandescent gases, we shall find a spectrum of
an entirely new kind. Thus if we examine an ordinary
gaslight through a slit with a prism, we shall obtain a
continuous spectrum, in consequence of the luminous
portion of the flame consisting of solid carbon in a state
of incandescence; but if we turn down the flame, so as
to lessen the amount of carbon to be burned, we shall
find the whole of that body is converted into feebly luminous
gas, giving off a faint reddish blue light. If we
now again examine it in the same manner, we shall find
that the spectrum produced consists of black spaces,
here and there crossed by a few faint coloured lines or
bands. The reason of this is obvious: in the faint flame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>caused by the carbon and hydrogen in a state of luminous
vapour, which only have a few of the colours of the
spectrum, which, when passed through the prism, fall
into their proper places. All substances with which we
are acquainted are capable of being converted into luminous
vapour by means of heat, and when thus burnt
produce flames of more or less faint luminosity, generally
characteristically coloured. A piece of soda
inserted in the wick of a spirit-lamp gives a yellow tinge
to the flame; a morsel of saltpetre (nitrate of potash)
or nitrate of strontia will give a purple and crimson
tint respectively. These hues are caused by the metals
sodium, potassium, and strontium contained in these
salts being converted into luminous vapour. On analyzing
these coloured flames with a prism, as before, we
should find in the case of the soda a single broad yellow
line, situated just in the middle of the yellow portion of
the spectrum, the rest of the space where the spectrum
should be being perfectly dark. The reason of this is
pretty simple. Sodium burns with a pure yellow flame,
consequently when passed through a prism it cannot
split into any other colours, but takes its place in the
position belonging to yellow of that particular hue.
Were it a little more orange or green in tint, it would
take its place nearer to the red or violet end of the
spectrum. The light from saltpetre, which contains
potassium may next be examined. It will be found to
tinge the flame with the spirit-lamp of a beautiful purple.
We can almost guess what will happen when this flame
is submitted to the action of the prism. We shall find
that the purple light emitted will split into red and
violet, which will immediately arrange themselves in
their proper positions according to their hues. If in
like manner we substitute nitrate of strontia for saltpetre,
we shall get a splendid crimson flame which is
decomposed by the prism into red, orange, or blue.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>On submitting the compounds of the other elements
to the same tests, we shall find that each of them, when
converted into luminous gas, is capable of producing
coloured lines of various kinds when the light of their
flames is passed through a prism. If, therefore, we had
a number of salts of whose composition we were ignorant,
all we need do is to burn them in a spirit-lamp,
and by the number and position in the lines of their
spectra we should be able to tell immediately of what
they were composed.</p>

<p class='c021'>The spectra of nearly all the elements capable of
being connected with luminous gas have been determined
with great accuracy. Perhaps the number and position
of the lines of a few spectra will be interesting to the
student.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Sodium.</i>—This is the metallic base of soda salts, and
gives a double bright yellow line in the middle of the
yellow.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Potassium.</i>—The base of the various salts of potash.
It gives one line in the extreme red, one in the middle
of the red, one in the violet, and a peculiar glow in the
centre of the spectrum.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Strontium.</i>—The base of the strontia salts, of which
the nitrate is used as the principal ingredient in the red
fire of the theatres. It gives a group of lines in the
red and orange, and a beautiful blue one in the middle
of the blue.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Barium.</i>—The base of the baryta salts, one of which
is used in making green fire. It gives several strong
lines in the green, and a few in the red, orange, and
yellow.</p>

<p class='c021'>After the position of the spectral lines of most of the
elements had been discovered, Messrs. Bunsen and
Kirchhoff were one day examining the saline deposit of
a spring which issues from the earth near Durkheim, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the Palatinate, and were surprised to find that a blue
line belonging to no known metal made its appearance
in addition to the potassium, sodium, and other lines
produced by the saline ingredients of the water. These
philosophers immediately concluded that the unknown
line was caused by an unknown metal, and they at once
set to work to obtain a larger quantity of the saline
residue from the spring. They evaporated down no less
than forty tons of water, and succeeded in isolating the
new substance, which turned out to be a metal resembling
potassium. While examining the residue more
carefully, a new, dark <i>red</i> line, beyond that belonging
to potassium, was discovered, pointing to the existence
of a second new element, which was also afterwards obtained
in the pure state. These two new metals, which
closely resemble potassium in their properties, were
named in accordance with the lines given by them when
converted into luminous gas. The first was called cæsium,
from <i>cœsius</i>, Lat. light blue; and the other, rubidium,
from <i>rubidus</i>, Lat. dark red. Since the publication
of MM. Bunsen and Kirchhoff’s experiments, these
two elements have been found in comparatively large
quantities in various minerals, and these properties have
been closely studied.</p>

<p class='c021'>Spectrum analysis has yielded us two more new
metals since first these philosophers applied the prism
to the determination of the chemical composition of
various bodies. Mr. W. Crookes, F.R.S., an English
chemist of eminence, while examining the flame of a
deposit obtained during the manufacture of sulphuric
acid from a certain sulphur mineral found in the Hartz
mountains, perceived a brilliant green line with which
he was previously unacquainted, which quickly flashed
into view, and then disappeared. After numerous experiments
on various other minerals (for the deposit he had
first experimented upon only yielded him a few grains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>of the new body), Mr. Crookes succeeded in discovering
a comparatively large quantity of it in a sulphur mineral
found in Belgium. The new element was found to be
a heavy metal, closely resembling lead in its properties.
It was named by the discoverer, thallium, from the
Greek word <i>thallos</i>, a green twig, from the brilliancy of
the single green line that indicates its presence. In
like manner, Messrs. Reich and Richter have discovered
a fourth new metal, which has been named <i>indium</i>, from
its principal lines being found in the centre of the <i>indigo</i>
of the spectrum.</p>

<p class='c021'>The delicacy of spectrum analysis may be imagined
from the fact that a quantity of sodium amounting to
less than the <i>two-millionth</i> of a grain can be detected by
its means. Indeed, it has taught us that sodium in one
form or other exists almost everywhere. This mode
of analysis is only serviceable to indicate the composition
of any salt or other substance, the quantities of the
different elements found by its use having no influence
on the appearances brought out by the prism. Thus,
a substance which has only been contaminated with sodium
from being handled by warm fingers, will show the yellow
bands as strongly as if it contained a large proportion
of that metal.</p>

<p class='c021'>For ordinary experiments in spectrum analysis the
apparatus used is very simple. It consists of a tube
with a fine slit at one end, and a convex lens at the
other, for concentrating the light from the coloured
flame upon the centre of the prism. After the light
passes through the prism, it is examined by a small
telescope of low magnifying power. The lamp used
may be either a spirit-lamp or a colourless gas flame
into which the substance to be examined is introduced
upon a platinum wire.</p>

<p class='c021'>We now come to another very important discovery,
made by means of our prism and narrow slit—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>determination of the composition of the photosphere or
mass of luminous vapour surrounding the body of the
sun.</p>

<p class='c021'>A simple experiment will show how this brilliant discovery
was arrived at. The light of a candle or other
flame containing incandescent <i>solid</i> matter is passed
through the spectroscope, and is found to decompose
into a continuous spectrum, uninterrupted by dark lines.
Between the light and the slit a spirit-lamp is placed,
but no difference in the appearance of the spectrum is
perceived. Introduce, however, the smallest portion of
a soda salt into the non-luminous flame of the second-lamp,
and a broad black line is immediately seen, crossing
the middle of the yellow portion of the band of colour.
Remove the sodium flame and the band disappears;
but do the same with the lamp producing the
spectrum, and the spectrum of course disappears, and
the dark band caused by the sodium flame is changed
to the yellow line produced by that metal. The same
experiments may be tried with potassium, strontium,
and other metals; and we shall always find that when
a coloured flame is introduced between an incandescent
solid and its continuous spectrum, it produces a series
of black lines corresponding to the substances by which
it is coloured. Thallium, in like manner, would give a
black band in the middle of the green, and indium a
similar one in the indigo. (<a href='#i004a'>Fig. 6</a>, Frontispiece).</p>

<p class='c021'>The exact position of the black band in the middle of
the yellow is shown in the coloured figure of the spectrum
so beautifully printed in the frontispiece of this
book, and it has been found to correspond exactly with
the dark line <span class='fss'>D</span> of the solar spectrum. The inference
from this fact is obvious. The incandescent portion of
the sun gives off light corresponding in its properties to
that emitted by the solid matter contained in the candle
flame, but the photosphere containing the vapour of sodium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>cuts off that portion corresponding to the sodium
line. Accurate measurements prove that numberless
other lines occurring in the solar spectrum are due to
the vapours of other well known metals existing on the
earth. Amongst these may be mentioned potassium,
calcium (the base of lime), iron, nickel, chromium, and
several others. This discovery with regard to the sun
has resulted in the spectral examination of a large number
of the fixed stars and nebulæ. For centuries the
fixed stars refused to answer all questions put to them
by mortals. The telescope showed them merely as bright
points. Their nature and origin remained a beautiful
mystery, until Dr. Miller, Mr. Huggins, Father Secchi,
and a few other philosophers interrogated them in a
manner that could not fail to draw forth an answer.
They brought their light within range of their prisms,
and forthwith they declared themselves to be suns like
our own. It is true that before this they were looked
on by most astronomers as bodies analogous to our
own sun, but it was only reasoning from analogy, after
all; but we are now able to assert with all the certainty
that is compatible with human fallibility that many of
these heavenly bodies are possessed of an incandescent
centre, surrounded by a photosphere or envelope of
gaseous matter in a luminous condition. It would be
impossible to give a list of all the stars that have been
examined up to the present time; the composition of
the photospheres of a few must therefore suffice. It is
singular that the elements hitherto discovered in the
stars are those which are more or less abundant on the
earth. Amongst them we may name hydrogen, nitrogen,
sodium, magnesium, barium, iron, antimony, bismuth,
tellurium, and mercury. The bright star in the
constellation of Orion known as Betelgeux is one of the
most singular in composition, the lines of its spectrum
indicating the absence of hydrogen. If, as Messrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Huggins and Miller suggest, the worlds revolving round
this star are also deficient in this element, they would
be without water, like our moon.</p>

<p class='c021'>Upon a very clear night it may be noticed that the
stars are not all of the same colour, but that many of
them appear to be of a ruddy or yellowish tint. The
cause of this is plainly seen when they are submitted to
spectral analysis. Thus, Sirius, which is a brilliant
white star, shows but three dark lines, while one of the
stars in the constellation of Hercules shows several
groups of bands in the red, blue, and green portions of
its spectrum, fully accounting for its orange tint.</p>

<p class='c021'>The double star <i>β</i> Cygni is a very beautiful example
of the distribution of colour between two members of a
stellar group. One star shows a strong spectrum with
the blue and violet portions almost totally blotted out,
while its companion is similarly circumstanced with respect
to the yellow and orange portions of its spectrum.
The colour of one is consequently orange, while the
other is of a delicate blue. If these stars are the
principal members of a system, the alternation of blue
and orange days must be indeed a singular phenomenon
to those who inhabit their planets.</p>

<p class='c021'>In some of the stars lines have been discovered
which do not possess any equivalent amongst those produced
by terrestrial matter; they consequently contain
elements of which we know nothing; at the same time,
however, it has been found that terrestrial elements
exist in some of the remote nebulæ, which are so distant
that their light takes many thousands of years to
reach our earth.</p>

<p class='c021'>Spectrum analysis has decided the grand question of
the physical composition of the nebulæ. Those bodies
were supposed, with some reason, to be aggregations of
stars, like our Milky Way, which only required telescopes
of sufficient power to resolve them. That they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>partly consist of gaseous matter in a luminous condition
is evidenced by their showing a series of bright lines in
the spectroscope, exactly like those produced by terrestrial
gases. Their light is therefore not emitted by a
solid or liquid incandescent body, but by a glowing gas.
The lines mentioned by Messrs. Huggins and Miller
showed that the nebula in the sword-handle of Orion
consists of hydrogen and nitrogen in a state of luminous
incandescence. Not the slightest trace of a continuous
spectrum can be detected in the light emanating from
this body; consequently, according to present hypotheses,
it contains no solid matter at all. A number of
other nebulæ have given similar results.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are numerous star clusters which, unlike the
true nebulæ, give continuous spectra when their light
is submitted to the action of the prism. Of these may
be specially mentioned the great clusters in Andromeda
and Hercules, which give continuous spectra, interrupted
by dark bands on the red and orange. The
light thrown by these experiments upon the nebular
hypotheses of Sir William Herschel, who considered
that true nebulæ consisted of the primordial gaseous
matter out of which suns and stars have been elaborated,
is very great, and will be appreciated even by
those whose knowledge of astronomy is small.</p>

<p class='c021'>Spectral analysis has also been the means of our witnessing
a celestial conflagration, and understanding the
cause of this marvellous event. It is well known to
most people that from time to time stars have suddenly
burst upon us, and have almost as suddenly disappeared.
The theories advanced to account for these singular
celestial visitors, have been more numerous than satisfactory.
In May 1866, a star of the second magnitude
suddenly burst forth in the Northern Crown, and
was almost immediately noticed by Mr. Huggins who
brought every power of prism and telescope to bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>upon this extraordinary celestial phenomenon. He
found the spectrum of the star to consist of two distinct
spectra, one being formed by four bright lines, the
other analogous to the spectra of the sun and stars.
Consequently two kinds of light were given off by this
star; one forming a series of bright lines indicative of
luminous gas, the other consisting of a continuous
spectrum, crossed by dark lines, showing the existence
of a solid body in a state of incandescence, surrounded
by a photosphere of luminous vapours. Two of the
bright lines undoubtedly showed the presence of
hydrogen in a state of illumination, the great brightness
of the lines indicating that the burning gas was
hotter than the photosphere. These facts taken in
conjunction with the suddenness of the outburst in the
star, and its immediate decline in brightness from the
second down to the eighth magnitude in twelve days,
suggest the startling speculation that the star had become
suddenly wrapped in the flames of burning
hydrogen, consequent possibly on some violent convulsion
in the interior of the star having set free
enormous quantities of this gas. As the free hydrogen
became exhausted, the spectrum showing the bright
lines gradually waned until the star decreased in brilliancy.
It must not be forgotten that the event seen by
Mr. Huggins occurred many years ago, and that the
light emitted by this marvellous celestial convulsion has
been travelling to us ever since.</p>

<p class='c021'>Comets and meteors have been submitted to the test
of spectral analysis. The former erratic visitors have
been but few and small since stellar spectrum analysis
has been perfected. In January 1866, Mr. Huggins
brought his apparatus to bear upon a small comet,
which gave a somewhat unexpected result. When the
object was viewed in the spectroscope, two spectra were
distinguishable—a very faint continuous spectrum of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the tail, showing that it reflected solar light, and a
bright space towards the centre of the spectrum, indicating
that the nucleous was self-luminous and gaseous.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Alexander Herschel—the nephew and the grandson
of Sir John and Sir William Herschel—has recently
succeeded in obtaining indications of the composition
of the meteors that people the heavens in the months
of August and November. The principal result of his
observations appears to be, that sodium in a state of
luminous vapour is present in the trains left behind
these singular bodies.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lightning has also been similarly examined, and lines
showing that hydrogen and nitrogen were rendered luminous
during the electrical discharge, were seen with
great distinctness. In fact, the applications of the
prism to scientific discovery are almost endless, and
in describing them it is difficult to tell where to draw
the line.</p>

<p class='c021'>Before quitting this subject, it will be as well to say
a few words on the fluorescent rays of the spectrum, to
which allusion has already been made towards the end
of <a href='#ch2-04'>Chapter IV</a>., Part II. It was there said that the
chemical power of the spectrum extends to some distance
beyond the extreme violet, a fact that may be
readily proved by exposing a piece of photographic
paper to the action of the dark portion of the spectrum.
Professor Stokes found that there were means of rendering
these rays visible to the eye by altering their rate
of vibration. This he found was possible by passing
them through the solutions of certain substances, such
as sulphate of quinine, horse-chestnut bark, &amp;c. We
have already said, that light vibrating at the rate of
from 458 to 727 billion times a second, was capable of
exciting luminous sensations upon the optic nerve. The
latter is the rate of vibration of the extreme violet ray,
and it has been found that the eyes of many persons are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>not sufficiently sensitive to be influenced by it; it is,
therefore, just probable that there are animals whose
eyes are so much more sensitive than ours, that they
can see rays that exist far beyond those seen by us.
Now, as difference of colour is produced by difference
in the rate of vibration, it follows that those whose eyes
are sensitive enough to perceive the extreme violet rays,
see tints of violet that are inappreciable by others.</p>

<p class='c021'>The power of sulphate of quinine in reducing the
luminous vibrations is easily seen by passing a tube
filled with the solution successively through each of the
colours of the spectrum formed by a quartz prism; the
ordinary colours will pass through the liquid as if it
were simply water, but on arriving near the violet
extremity a gleam of pale blue light will shoot across
the tube, and continue to increase. As it is moved
onwards the light will gradually die away, until a point
is reached nearly equal in length to the whole of the
visible spectrum, when it will disappear altogether. It
is somewhat singular that no substance has yet been
found that will increase the refrangibility of the dark
rays beyond the red end of the spectrum. There are
many artificial flames which produce this dark light (if
we may use such a paradoxical expression) in greater
quantity than the sun, whose light is no doubt greatly
deteriorated in this respect during its passage through the
atmosphere. The substance of which the prism is made
also greatly influences the length of the invisible portion
of the spectrum. By using a quartz prism and
lenses of the same material Professor Stokes, found that
the spectrum of the electric light could be traced for a
distance equal to six times that of the visible portion.</p>

<p class='c021'>The action of certain substances in rendering the invisible
rays of light perceptible may be easily shown
by any one possessing a horse-chestnut tree. A weak
decoction of the inner portion of the bark having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>made and filtered through blotting-paper, or at any rate
allowed to settle, the room is made quite dark and a
piece of common brimstone is ignited. The pale blue
light given off is comparatively feeble, but it is very
rich in the ultra-violet rays; consequently, when the
infusion of horse-chestnut bark is poured into a tall jar
of water, beautiful waves of phosphorescent light are
seen flashing backwards and forwards as the two liquids
mingle. The tincture of stramonium is also possessed
of this property, and characters traced on paper with
it, although nearly invisible by ordinary daylight, appear
distinctly when examined by the light of burning
sulphur.</p>

  <h2 id='ch3-10' class='c012'>CHAPTER X.<br /><span class='c020'>SPECTRES—THE GHOST ILLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>We</span> close our account of the wonders of optics by a
description of the ghost illusion, which has been exhibited
with such great success by M. Robin, the well-known
French conjurer, Mr. Pepper, the enterprising
manager of the Royal Polytechnic Institution, and several
others. Before doing so, however, we will say a few
words on those unpleasant visitations known as spectres,
to which some people are liable, either through an over-worked
brain or some organic disease.</p>

<p class='c021'>The peculiar appearances known as spectres in optics
are certain illusions of vision in which an object is apparently
presented to the view which does not really
exist. In such cases either the brain, the retina, or the
optic nerve are unnaturally excited, and made sensitive
to an appearance that, physically speaking, does not
exist. There is such a close connexion between the
senses and the mind, that we continually, and without
knowing it, transfer to the physical world that which
belongs to the domain of thought. A picture which has
struck us during the day will reappear to us at night
during sleep, with every detail perfect, or possibly under
a form modified by the capricious wanderings of our
thoughts. A sudden fright may sometimes be the cause
of optical illusions which will pursue us unceasingly.
Fear, despair, passion, ambition, and other violent mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>phases, are capable of evoking images closely connected
with the state of our brain, appearances that we
often take for realities, and whose truths we have to
test by our faculty of reasoning, before we can set them
down as positive illusions. “In the most insignificant
phenomena,” says Sir David Brewster, “we find that
the retina is so powerfully influenced by exterior impressions
as to retain the images of visible objects for a
long time after they have passed out of sight; besides,
this portion of the eye is so strongly influenced by local
impressions of which we know neither the nature nor
the origin, that we see the shapeless forms of coloured
light moving about in the dark. In fact we have, in
the cases of Newton and many others, examples of the
ease with which the imagination revivifies the images
of luminous objects for months or even years, after
these impressions took place. After the occurrence of
such phenomena, the mind can readily comprehend how
thin is the division that separates reality from those
spectral illusions which during a particular state of
health have afflicted the most intelligent men, not merely
those belonging to the community at large, but also
the most learned philosophers.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Spectres may properly be divided into two classes,
those which may be termed subjective, which result from
some unnatural action of our minds or bodies, and
which properly belong to the science of physiology, and
those which may be called objective, which are caused
by some peculiar illusion acting on us from without.
We shall pass lightly over the first, illustrating them
by a single example, while we shall pay more serious
attention to those belonging to the second class.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Walter Scott, in his <i>Letters on Demonology and
Witchcraft</i>, mentions a remarkable instance of the first
order of spectres. A doctor of eminence was called in
to attend a gentleman who occupied a high place in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>particular department connected with the administration
of justice. Until the time that the physician’s services
became necessary, he had shown strong common sense
and extraordinary firmness and integrity in every case
in which he had been called upon to arbitrate. But after
a certain epoch his temper became saddened, although
his mind preserved its habitual strength and calmness.
At the same time, the feebleness of his pulse, the loss
of appetite, and impaired digestion seemed to point out
to his medical adviser the existence of some serious
source of disturbance. At first the sick man seemed
inclined to keep the cause of the change in his health a
profound secret; but his melancholy bearing, confused
answers, and the badly disguised constraint with which
he sharply replied to the interrogations of the doctor,
caused the latter to seek for information as to the cause
of the disorder in other directions. He made minute
inquiries of the various members of his unhappy patient’s
family, but he could obtain no explanation of the
mystery. Every one was lost in conjecture as to the
reason of the alarming condition of the patient, which
did not appear to be justified by any loss of fortune or
beloved friends. His age rendered the idea of an unsuccessful
love affair improbable, and his known integrity
precluded the possibility of remorse. The doctor accordingly
was compelled to return once more to the straight
road, and he used the most serious arguments with his patient
to induce him to conquer his obstinacy. At last
the doctor’s efforts took effect; the patient allowed himself
to be convinced, and manifested his desire to open
his mind frankly to the doctor. They were accordingly
left alone, all the doors were securely fastened, and the
patient made the following singular avowal.</p>

<p class='c021'>“You cannot be more firmly convinced, my dear
friend, than I am myself, that I am on the eve of death,
crushed by the fatal malady which has dried up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>sources of my life. You remember, without doubt, the
disease of which the Duke of Olivarez died in Spain?”</p>

<p class='c021'>“From the idea,” replied the doctor, “that he was
pursued by an apparition in whose existence he did not
believe, and he died from the continual presence of this
imaginary vision weighing down his strength, and breaking
his heart.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Well, my dear doctor,” the patient went on, “I am
in the same condition, and the presence of the vision
that persecutes me is so painful and frightful, that my
reason is totally helpless in controlling the effects of my
imagination, and I feel that I am dying from the effects
of an imaginary illness. My visions began two or three
years since. At first I found myself embarrassed from
time to time by the presence of a great cat, which appeared
and disappeared I knew not how. But at last
the truth flashed across my mind, and I was compelled
to look upon the creature, not as an ordinary domestic
animal, but as a vision which had its origin in some derangement
of the organs of sight or in my imagination.
I have no antipathy to cats, in fact I am rather fond of
them, so I endured the presence of my imaginary companion
so well that at last I treated the whole affair
with indifference. But at the end of several months
the cat disappeared, and was replaced by a spectre of
greater importance, and whose exterior was, to say the
least of it, very imposing. It was neither more nor less
than one of the high officials of the House of Lords, in
the full dress belonging to his dignity.</p>

<p class='c021'>“This personage, who was in court dress, with a bag-wig
on his head, and a sword by his side, his coat splendidly
embroidered and his <i>chapeau bras</i> under his arm,
glided along by my side like a shadow. Whether I was
in my own house or elsewhere, he mounted the stairs
before me, as if to announce my coming. Sometimes he
seemed to mix with the company, although it was evident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>that no one remarked his presence, and I was the sole
witness of the chimerical honours that this imaginary
individual seemed to render to me. This phantasy of
my brain did not make a very strong impression on me,
although it made me conceive doubts as to the state of
my health, and the effects it would produce upon my
reason.</p>

<p class='c021'>“This second phase of my malady, like the first, also
came to an end. Some months after, the usher of the
Upper House ceased showing himself, and he was replaced
by an apparition that was at once wearing to the
mind and terrible to the sight. It was a skeleton.
Whether I was alone or in company this frightful image
of death never quitted me; it dogged my footsteps and
followed me everywhere, and seemed to be a shadow
inseparable from myself. It was in vain that I repeated
to myself a hundred times over that the vision was not
real, and was only an illusion of my senses. The reasoning
of philosophy and my religious principles, strong
though they are, are powerless to triumph over the influence
that besets me, and I feel that I shall die a
victim to this cruel evil.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“It seems then,” interrupted the doctor, “that this
skeleton is always before your eyes?”</p>

<p class='c021'>“It is my evil fate to see it continually before me.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“In which case it is at this moment visible to your
eyes?”</p>

<p class='c021'>“It is at present.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“And in what part of the room do you imagine that
you see it now?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p class='c021'>“At the foot of my bed,” replied the patient: “when
the curtains are half open I can see it place itself in the
empty space between them.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“You say that you are convinced that it is only an illusion,”
replied the doctor; “have you the firmness to convince
yourself of it positively? Have you the necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>courage to get up and go and place yourself in the
position which appears to be occupied by the spectre, in
order to demonstrate to yourself positively that it is
only a vision?”</p>

<p class='c021'>The unfortunate man sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Well,” went on the doctor, “let us try another
plan.”</p>

<p class='c021'>He quitted the chair on which he was sitting, at the
head of his patient’s bed, and placing himself between
the half opened curtains, in the place where the patient
had pointed out the skeleton, he asked if the apparition
was still visible.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Not the whole of it,” answered the patient, “because
you are standing between him and me; but I see
his skull looking at me over your shoulder.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In spite of his philosophy, the learned physician could
not help starting to hear that the spectre was immediately
behind him. He had recourse to other questions,
and tried endless remedies, but without success. The
prostration of the patient, however, increased, and he
died in the same distress of mind in which he had passed
the last months of his life. This example is a sad proof
of the power of the imagination over the life of the body
even when the terrors endured are powerless in destroying
the judgment of the unfortunate sufferer. We will
say more; men who have the strongest nerves are not
free from similar illusions.</p>

<p class='c021'>The second kind of spectres, in which the science of
optics plays so important a part, is the result of the
imagination being deceived by art with the assistance of
science.</p>

<p class='c021'>These spectres are displayed in the ghost trick which
has been practised at various Parisian theatres for a
number of years, with very great success, more especially
at the <i>Théâtres du Châtelet</i> and <i>Dejazet</i>. The Adelphi,
in London, also employed Mr. Pepper to heighten the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>effect of the excellent acting of Mr. Toole and Mrs. Alfred
Mellon, in the dramatic version of Dickens’ “Haunted
Man,” by the introduction of various spectral effects.
And the same trick was also called into requisition with
some success in several of the minor theatres in New
York and other cities of the United States. At the
Polytechnic, in London, very remarkable effects were
produced, and few who ever saw them will forget the
surprise they felt at seeing the first representation
of an imponderable ghost endowed with motion, and
even speech. Amongst the most successful productions
in this way was the entertainment of M.
Robin, one of the cleverest of the many successors of
the great Robert Houdin, the prince of prestidigitators.
M. Robin claims to be the inventor of the ghost illusion,
and to have shown it frequently since 1847. Whether
this be so or not it is not our business to decide, but we
can testify that his exhibition in the Boulevard du
Temple drew all Paris to see it. Evening after evening
he not only “called spirits from the vasty deep,” but
“made them come.” He pierced them with swords, he
fired pistols through them, and he made them appear
and disappear at his slightest wish. He showed the
Zouave at Inkermann, lying dead amongst a heap of
slain, who at the familiar sound of the drum, rose, pale
and grave, and showed the bleeding wounds from which
he died. Amongst other scenes shown by M. Robin was
one of a spectre appearing to an armed man, who after
trying in vain to shut out the vision from his sight fires
a pistol at the intruder. <a href='#i272'>Fig. 72</a> shows the scene as seen
by the audience, and <a href='#i273'>fig. 73</a>, the method by which the
illusion is worked. The theatre is shown in section. On
the left, at the end, are seen the spectators; on the right is
the stage upon which the scene is represented. Beneath
the stage is an actor clothed in white to personate a
ghost, whose image is reflected by the glass above.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>This glass is placed at an angle, and fills up the whole
of the front of the stage, the edges being carefully concealed
by curtains. The glass of course must be of a
very large size, and should be of the very best quality,
so that it cannot be seen by the audience. The actor
must take care to place himself in such a position as to
counteract the effect produced by the glass being placed
at an angle. At first the cavalier is seen sitting at a
table. After soliloquizing for a time in a very remorseful
manner touching several murders that he has committed,
the ghost of one of his victims gradually appears.
This is effected by gently turning the electric light upon
the concealed actor. The murderer and victim parley for
a short time, when the former, being unable to withstand
the reproaches of the ghost any longer, fires a pistol at
him point-blank. The ball of course takes no effect, so
the villain draws a sword, but before it has left its
scabbard the spirit of the victim has vanished with a
mocking laugh, or, in other words, the electric light is
suddenly turned off. The management of the light is
exceedingly difficult under these circumstances; the
theatre, the stage, and the portion beneath ought to be
lighted in a very careful manner, for if either is too
bright or too dark it mars the whole effect. It must be
remembered, too, that the person performing the part of
the spectre and the real actor above cannot see each
other, consequently all their action has to be carried
on by guess-work. The actor below has to walk along
an inclined plane, keeping himself exactly at right angles
to it. Again, the movements of the latter are obliged to
be reversed; for the cavalier already mentioned drew
his sword with his left hand in order that the reflected
figure should appear to use the right.</p>

<p class='c021'>When well arranged, the ghost trick leaves far behind
all the efforts of a similar nature that were obtained by
the ancients in the way of magical illusions. It is also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>incontestably true, contrary to what some people have
supposed, that they were unable to perform this illusion
in the way we have described, for they were ignorant of
the method of manufacturing and polishing glass plates
of sufficient size and clearness for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c021'>The production of living but impalpable spectres is
thus a completely modern achievement, as we have
already proved, and which has taken its place amongst
the applications of science to stage art, to the total exclusion
of all effects depending for their production on
the old-fashioned phantasmagoria and magic lantern.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
